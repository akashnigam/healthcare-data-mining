Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/66222/fluid-in-bursa-sac,Fluid in Bursa Sac,"I have sharp pain on inside of my left hip near my groin anytime I try to lift my leg. Four years ago I actually had to have two of my bursa sacs drained (aspirated) with a needle. Once the fluid was drained, I felt instantaneous and complete pain relief. The Dr. used a screen that helped him direct where the needle was going. The procedure was painless and only took 15 minutes. My problem seems to have returned. Same symptoms. This has been an issue for me since Jan. 2018. My ortho Dr. Just doesn't seem to get it.  1. I need to find a Dr. In the Atlanta area that is equipped and is knowledgeable and capable if doing this procedure.  2. What type of Dr. does this procedure. Ie, what specialty?

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/61568/spinal-injection,Spinal injection?,"Soliciting opinions. I experienced a C6-C7 slipped disc about two months ago. It severely impinged the left foraminal nerve and caused severe radiculopathic pain in my arm and shoulder. Baseline maybe 5-6 level pain escalating to 8-9, especially at night. I finally got in to see a neurosurgeon two weeks ago. He wanted to wait another six weeks before scheduling surgery, and in the meantime, prescribed gabapentin, PT, and a traction collar. He also referred me to his pain doctor for a spinal injection. He said that because I have such a concrete and easily identified injury, the injections would be especially likely to relieve the pain. Good news: The gabapentin, PT and traction collar (plus time) have worked! The pain is down to maybe a 1-2, maybe bumping up to a 3-4 at the end of the day when I need to take another gabapentin. I've even been able to start running again, which is doing wonders for my sanity. Question: Should I still get the injection? It potentially would allow me to get the pain down to zero and stop the gabapentin, and if (as I suspect) the disc is healing, everything might be healed once the injection wears off in a month or two. On the other hand, things are going well now, so maybe best not to upset the proverbial apple cart. Those injections do carry a small risk of complications or potentially making things worse.

If I ware normal tennis shoes for so much as a half hour, my toe will gradually start to hurt again and continue hurting for 1-3 days. Any shoe (even loose fitting) touches the toe at all will cause it to hurt. Flipflops are fine, and I cut a hole in the side of a normal shoe to keep it from touching the toe - that works fine too. A recent x-ray showed that there is no break or malformation in the toe. The main piece of information I want to know is what is wrong with the toe joint. I haven't been able to search for treatments very well simply because I don't know a combination of words that describe what the problem is.",

You see, I have been diagnosed with at least three debilitating diseases already: Fibromyalgia, mild Scoliosis, and I have had juvenile arthritis since I was a young teenager(that has gotten worse from then till now that I am 30 years old). I have an exaggerated slump, I have had ankle surgery, I have been in an automobile accident which mildly injured my knees(but I was able to walk right out of the vehicle, as did the other two guys I was with without any problems. I have had only two major concussions in my lifetime. All of these injuries still affect me till this very day! My pain is so bad that my brain literally dopes me up constantly with feel-good neurotransmitters. I won't lie, my brain has always doped me up, even before I ever used marijuana and opiates/opioids, which I started using when I turned 18. I am always in agonizing pain, but my pain medication does help mitigate some of the pain; yet without pain meds, I literally feel crippled, even though I am largely mobile on my own. So, to recap, I have pain in my nerves, my muscles, and my bones.  If you know what this could possibly be with an educated guess(not just any guess), then please sort of, suggest, what you think it is.

I also have a litany of other health problems that no doctor has been able to decipher.  What I’m looking for is someone who can point me in the direction of an effective, affordable medical professional close to home (NE Dallas suburbs) who can provide real solutions to my health problems. Here is the long list of my health problems, things I’ve tried, and restrictions on what I can try next: Health problems Upper back and neck pain for about 12 years No MRI, X-ray, or other scan has ever revealed anything significant to any doctor, including the nation’s best spine specialists in the DC area. Back pain has spread to my lower back over the past three years It now feels like I have a severely broken joint/disc of some kind in my lower back It is impossible to stand up straight anymore It is very difficult to walk My poor posture from the back problems has led to pain spreading throughout my legs, causing very strained thighs and knees. It has also led to very weak and clumsy arms and hands I also have severe digestive problems that have loosely been called IBS-D. This keeps my energy level, appetite, and strength very low Things I’ve tried  Many many licensed, respectable, highly reputable doctors across the country, literally from coast to coast. Including general primary care doctors, spine specialists, GI specialists, pain management specialists, chiropractors, rolfing, airrosti, physical therapy, massage therapy, accupuncture, nutritionists, psychologists, psychiatrists, etc. I’ve actually followed the directions of these specialists for years and found little to no relief. Restrictions that make it hard to find help now My health has gotten much worse over the past two years. It is now very difficult to walk, keep my energy level up, and focus for very long.  I’m now very low on money.  I worked decent-paying white collar desk jobs around DC as a PR manager for a few years. I had some income and full benefits. But health insurance covered very little of the financial burden. So I burned through a great deal of money trying new doctors and trying to pay for the exorbitant testing and treatments they prescribed. I started my career in the US Air Force. So I am a veteran with an honorable discharge and proof of service (DD Form 214). I’ve been to military hospitals across the country while on active duty and to VA hospitals as a veteran. The level of care is atrocious. And they have taken to blatantly lying about how much the care will cost me. They have claimed it will be free only to send me massive bills several months later. The VA has been unable to offer any help. But my status as a veteran means that I don’t qualify for other low-income health care options. I also don’t qualify for the veterans choice program because I’m within 40 miles of the Dallas VA hospital.  I have no one who will help. Due to worsening health problems, I was coerced into moving home with my parents at the age of 32 last year. I didn’t know what to expect but didn’t think I could manage on my own at the time of decision. Once I had given up a lucrative job, friends, and a home in DC, I was stuck in Dallas in my parents house. They are upper middle class and enjoy perfect health in their late 60s. But they are extremely religious pseudo-faith healer believers and refused to offer any assistance to get medical help. And my health has worsened over the last year since moving home.  I do not fall into any other so-called “sympathy demographics” other than being a veteran. And I’m not a combat veteran, so I do not qualify for any of the countless charities helping combat veterans (such as the wounded warrior project). I’m 33, straight, white, male, single, no kids, veteran, with no medical testing to prove any health problems. I’m not healthy enough to work anymore to get money or health insurance. And I don’t have enough money to cover much more health care. And I have no one willing to help me find good health care. And I have no one to help me deal with the endless hassle and confusion of battling with doctors and their offices even if I could afford their services. This is another significant obstacle to getting help. I’m not in good health so I don’t feel strong enough to fight doctors to demand good solutions. And doctors have a first instinct to get rid of the patient as fast as possible while saddling them with an array of unfamiliar expensive tests. My health continues to worsen. I have been very blunt about this with my parents. They have clearly said they refuse to help. They said to get a job and move out. That is also my end goal. But I need better health to pull that off.  Please let me know if you know of anyone offering low-cost effective health care in the NE Dallas suburbs. I have a bit of money, no health insurance, and must drive myself to any appointments. So it must be within a short driving distance so I can safely get there. Thank you very much for any help.","Chronic Pain , Medication , Back Pain"

It has caused a range of pain over the years from no pain to dull pain to severe pain to can't hardly walk on it or lay on it at night. Sometimes, it swells and is sensitive to touch. I was told they are blood clots. The doctor told me there was no blood flow in it and hopes that over time my body will attack it and dissolve it, like it was a foreign object in there or something. Here's the thing, I did tear my ACL many years prior and assumed it had to do with that. Now, I don't believe so. This mass is moving up my leg and spreading wider on top of my knee.

At the time of and shortly after the collision I felt OK. About 90 minutes after the accident, however, I began to experience a headache the likes of which I'd never even imagined. I'm 56 years old and have never had headaches with any regularity. Sinus headaches occasionally but other than those, none. With this headache, my entire skull throbbed painfully and I experienced constant nausea and felt lightheaded upon standing. Because of NY state's no-fault laws it took two months to finally locate a physician who would take my case. During that time the headache was relentless.  After a diagnosis of migraine secondary to a whiplash injury, I began a regimen of trigger point and nerve block injections. After a few treatments, I began to experience a few pain-free days and the headaches that did occur were mostly mitigated with Sumatriptan tablets in between injections. A few months ago I had to change doctors. The new doctor seems to think that my headaches are coincidental despite my never having had more than one or two per year prior to the collision. I have had multiple CT scans which show herniation of C2-3. C4-5 are fused from another accident which occurred in 1980. The repair was completed using wire and I've had issues with MRI attempts in that region.  My question is, could my headaches simply be coincidental despite the cervical herniation? As stated earlier, I have no history of severe headaches, nor do any of my family members.  Thanks","Chronic Pain , Headaches , Migraines"

Almost 6 weeks ago, I fell on a patch of ice outside my work and sprained my ankle. I went to a doctor and got X rays done. The doctor called me the next morning and essentially just told me it wasn't a break. I spent 2.5 weeks resting, icing, elevating, wrapping. It was getting better, but I scheduled with an orthopedic specialist to see when she thought I could return to cardio - I work out regularly and running or at least doing the elliptical have always been part of the routine, it's been years since I've gone more than like 4 days without cardio. I took the results of my x ray, but didn't have the actual disc of the x ray. The specialist examined and diagnosed a high sprain, which is apparently worse than a regular sprain, and put me in an Aircast boot for 4 weeks. She said I could try the stationary bike or even the elliptical in the brace and I was excited. Well, 20 min on the bike had me in pain. I tried it again the next week, still pain. I tried it for 5 min the next week, pain. It's been 3 weeks in the brace, 6 weeks since the sprain, and I'm still in pain even though I'm resting all the time, icing 3 times a day, elevating when I can, taking anti inflammatories, wrapping in an ACE bandage, and wearing the brace most of the time I'm walking. Honestly, it feels like the pain has gotten worse. The pain I experienced after going without the brace for a while Monday was much worse than what I experienced after 20 min on the bike when I first got the brace. My muscles are tight and swollen and I'm experiencing shooting pains and sometimes burning. I can bear weight and walk fine, but I'm still just in pain. And my knees are hurting now too. I'm seeing the specialist Tuesday but I'm just reaching out to see if anyone else has experienced a high sprain and can tell me if it's normal to still have so much pain even after resting and taking care of it. My body image and mental health issues are awful right now, and I've been having panic attacks because I feel like something is permanently damaged and I'll never run again and I just can't imagine a life like that.

I get really intense pain usually during the first 5 minutes of a run on the outside of my leg near the shin bone down to my ankle. The muscles feel like they seize up and I lose the ability to move my foot heel to toe and instead it sort of smacks down on the ground. When I stop running, the mobility comes back really quickly and my leg is usually sore for a couple of days. My doctor does not believe it is shin splints and we have already x-rayed for fractures or any other bone issues. The pain and lack of mobility do not always occur.

I told DR I was not able to do this procedure due to extreme fear I have of ANY medical procedures done like this where there would likely be some pain involved, due to event that occurred as teenager with family dentist. He told me just to tell those doing the injections to numb me (back area) prior to giving me injections, insisting they would do this, so I agreed. When I went in to have spinal injection done & asked them to numb area that would be injected, they said they could not/would not do that. I started crying & shaking & told them I was scared of pain & could not do this, & then told my DR at my next appt when asked why I'd not kept that injection appt what had happened, to which he clearly was not ok with me not doing, & every month since, being told I needed to go back & have it done, & me telling him I could not, & why. Last month, he ended this conversation by telling me I had to have procedure done as he was supposed to be trying alternative ways to manage my back pain im attempt to get me off the Tramadol, & would he would not be increasing current dosage of Tramadol, or giving me anything any stronger if my pain was worse because I would not do the injections, to which I replied that I was not asking him to do that. Then yesterday my PCP DR told me if I did not have injections done, the pain mgmt DR would then be required by law to stop prescribing me the Tramadol. I'm on Medi-Cal/MediCaid, & want to know if anyone knows if this is true, or not.  My reasons for refusing the procedure stem from event that I still remember like it was yesterday - I was taken in by my mom for my regular check-up & had to go back to have 3 cavities filled. After 3 injections given to me in gums to deaden nerves & waiting 5-10 min to work, dentist began drilling. I screamed out immediately in pain, & told him I could still feel him drilling, which he didn't believe, however he administered a few more injections & waited another 5 min, he started drilling again, & again I screamed out in pain refusing to allow him to continue because I told him I could still feel him drilling as if I'd been given no novacaine at all. He called my mother in the room, telling her I wasn't cooperating & claimed I could feel the drilling, but he insisted there was no way I could feel anything due to the amount of novacaine he'd given me. So, my mom was on one side of me, & a nurse on the other, and they held me down so he could continue. I have never forgot that pain; & it has haunted me throughout my adult life - once I was out on my own I stopped going to dentists & doctors - until at 51 1/2 of my teeth had rotted out & had several abscesses from years of neglect, & had to have the 10-14 still left surgically removed while put to sleep. Started having very bad back pain a year later, & as my dad has serious back problems (he's had back surgery twice with each leaving him worse then he was before each. He's had pain pump put in under skin which is filled with morphine every few months to help with pain & is only mildly effective at doing this. He had to quit working abt 30 yrs back due to his back) & I take after him in nearly everything - including these back problems, which his dad also had. My PCP referred me to pain mgmt immediately after his initial script for tramadol & said I would have to get that script from them from then on, which I have done.  Is it true that my doctor will have to stop giving me the Tramadol because I do not want to have the spinal injections done, & leave me in excruciating pain for the numerous back problems I have which have been diagnosed thru X-rays, & MRI's?","Chronic Pain , Medication , Back Pain"

I am about 30 pounds overweight 	Early September this year my toddler daughter kicked me in the chest 2-3 times at the store when I was holding her. She kicked me around the middle and the middle sides of my chest. Also I think she kicked me in the upper middle and upper middle sides of my chest too. After a week My chest pain died down. After a a couple weeks my chest pain was gone.  I went to urgent care one week after I was kicked in the chest. My chest was not hurting that much when I went in, but my head and neck was. The doctor diagnoses was: Strain of Muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level, initial encounter. The Doctor told me my lymph nodes were causing pain on the right side of my face and head. My chin, right cheek, and right forehead (felt a little tingly and a little numb). Pain went a away after a few days when I was taking my medication and did what she told me to do (mentioned below in this paragraph). I can't breath out of my nose that well, so I breath out my mouth. A ENT doctor told me before I would need a operation to breath out my nose better. The urgent care doctor told me to put a pillow under my back up to my neck when I sleep. I did this and after a few days the major pain went a away. The pillow worked.   	The doctor gave me a low dose muscle relaxer and a high dosage of Ibuprofen (800 mg every 8 hours). After the first day of taking Ibuprofen I had some tinnitus and some hearing problems (like my ear felt blocked for a few hours). After the second day of taking Ibuprofen I had non stop tinnitus for 6 days straight. I had a month and a half of blocked hearing and ear fullness/pressure in my left ear. A ENT doctor told me to have no extra salt, no soy and no msg in my diet. This diet did not help. When I started doing neck exercises (stretching) my ear went back to normal after 2 days and a lot of my head pain decreased. Note: I stopped taking the Ibuprofen after the second day. I guess I can't take ototoxic drugs. 	For about 6 weeks I did not have chest pain at all. About two weeks ago my chest pain started again. I think it might have been caused by holding my toddler daughter. She weights 40 pounds. The seat belt pressing against my chest causes my chest bone to hurt a little. Carrying bottled water aggravates my chest bone pain. My jacket sometimes aggravates my chest bone pain. Below are my current symptoms My current symptoms are: 1. Chest pain in the middle of my chest on the right middle side (mainly), middle middle of chest (sometimes), and (once in a while) pain on the right middle of my chest. Feels like bone pain. Pain will last usually from 30seconds to several minutes, then it goes a way or pain does not feel too bad after several minutes. Carrying anything over 20 pounds causes it to hurt a little to hurt some. 2. Chest pain in the upper middle right (of breastbone, pain mainly here), upper middle middle (sometimes), and pain on the upper left (once in a while). Feels like bone pain. Pain will last usually from 30seconds to several minutes, then it goes a way or pain does not feel to bad after several minutes. Carrying anything over 20 pounds causes it to hurt a little to hurt some. 3. On the inside on my chest (a couple inches or so inside of chest) on the middle sides (of chest) around the bottom of the lungs or top of liver I get some aching (sometimes its aching and thumping) pain. I am not sure if its muscle pain or what. This pain could last anywhere from a 30 seconds to several minutes to a half hour. Sometimes I get this pain when I sleep on my side. 4. On occasion if feels I might have some calcification on one of my bones--in this area (mentioned above in number 3.) it feels like the bone calcified a little and is poking my muscle and causing a little pain. This happens on occasion and does not last long. 5. A little pain on the front sides of my neck. Usually a 1-2 in pain, sometimes a 3 in pain. The pain usually stays with me most of the day. 6. I get pain once in a while in other parts of my chest. Sometimes about couple inches inside right behind my right pectoral muscle. This pain can last a few minutes to several minutes and then goes away. 7. Once in a while a little pain about a inch below the clavicle bone (by shoulder). It feels like a nerve or muscle pain. This pain could last from a few minutes to several minutes. Note: My LUNGS DO NOT hurt or bother me when I breath. I have GERD (acid reflux). I had doctors and a physical therapist tell me that I have tight tendons/muscles throughout my body. When I touch my chest I DO NOT FEEL TENDERNESS IN THE CHEST AREA. 1. What do you think I have (your diagnosis)? Do you think what I have could become serious or is not that serious? 2. Is there any treatments (and home treatments) I could do? How long should I have this pain (How long before it goes away)? 3. What do you recommend me to do?",

I can't get any help for pain outside the hospital. I am supposed to start more physical therapy again and I am in extreme pain in my last back and leg and groin areas.

Wow, this got long. Oh well, even if no one reads i can use it elsewhere i guess ) Okay, firstly i'm here now because after just getting off the phone with my doc who I wont see till the tenth I am flummoxed to her advice and what I should or can do.  ( For the second time, she suggested to 'lay in a dimly let room with a warm cloth on my head' and when she asked what im taking for the pain, Ibprofen like she told me to and if it helped, which is not much, she told me then to not take it. )   I've only seen her a few so far, so she is a rather new doctor for me and I feel there is alot more she should know about my issues.   ...but personally, so far I feel like she is not actually concerned or taking my problems seriously.   Her first advice for the migraine issue ( before the chronic onset )   was to stop taking any kind of headache medicine for a couple weeks or so and that taking it so often was the cause of them being so frequent. I went along with it, it wasn't fun and resulted in me simply suffering through them and inhibiting me from being able to do anything else really.   Before getting into some past info, whats been going on for the past several weeks has been rather unbearable...  I often have migraines, but been a very long time since theyve been this bad.   Every day, there is pressure on both sides of my head, specifically at temporalis area. Along with a horrible knot on the back of my skull, (occipatilis). My necks been stiff ( Sternocleidomastoid and trapezius mostly, but much of neck really ) especially awful are then occasional pops in the vertebrae, which despite all my efforts stretching properly usually feel like an awful pinch and burning instead of relief.  At the onset of this onslaught, i also had severe vision problems, eyes were very red and had ocular pain even when closed. My temples throbbed and ached, really my entire head. I felt feverish and been having awful memory problems and some problems with my balance too. And the terrible ringing in my ears, UGH. Sometimes its a real high pitched, intense tone that gradually fades ( feels kinda like someone hit the reset button on my brain for a moment) And ive realized the ear ringing is actually constant and nonstop now, just varying in strength.   I eventually was able to make a next day appointment with another doctor at the physicians building, who gave me a shot of turidol and something else for the nausea. I immediately regretted not remembering to ask if i should get an MRI or could be referred to a chiropractor or something. Honestly, i have no idea how i failed to bring that up when it was all i had been thinking about before.   So the shots helped, I was able to relax and get some relief for a while. As the migraines returned, they were accompanied by the severe neck issues and lower back ( lumbar ) as well.   It feels EXTREMELY stiff, like my spine is totally kinked and any kind of movement associated with it is met with very uncomfortable pain and resistance.   Im not sure if its possibly an underlying cause, or was made worse by not getting it enough exercise or something lately.   HOWEVER, just before all this I was lent a gazelle and have been using it frequently since. If anything ive been alot more active, despite the few days after the shot which I spent in bed primarily. After that though is when the overall stiffness became most apparent.   One thing i noticed right away using it is how strange it felt to use, as much as ive been using it ( this is rather hard to explain exactly ) it feels like my legs arent fully 'engaging', as if theres some disconnection or total weakness in my thighs an upper legs. I know how a total stride should feel, but even when i assist with my arms to get a stronger, deeper one... nothing.   And despite my efforts, ive gained back the weight i recently lost last month somehow.  I've gained considerable weight over past couple years, never been over 190 and now Im at 212-220. =(   My only past surgery was for my eyes years ago when i was having   similar migraine issues ( 6-8 hours at least, fever, unable to focus ) 'Strabismus' he diagnosed.

I have to wonder though now if it was merely a temporary fix to an underlying problem, as now Im experiencing the same thing again.   ...my eyes are visibly scarred forever and noticeably ( to me at least ) altered in position. Frequently dry eyes as well and most eye drops i cant use as they instead cause burning pain and irritation.  A couple years ago I saw a physical therapist who after making me into a pretzel, etc ( lol ) concluded I could have Marfans syndrome as i showed alot of characteristics. And after reading bout it, I felt the same. Enough to go and get an EKG done as he suggested, which came out fine. However, that just means it hasnt progressed to that stage ( aortic dilation or aneurysm ) which is the last fatal stages.   Further diagnosis however has eluded me so far, as there doesnt seem to be an easy way for me to get tested genetically locally.   Anyways, one of the symptoms is dural ectasia, which I feel perfectly fits several issues ive been having over the past few years.   ( the occasional bladder issues which have dumbfounded me, and the numbness which i apparently have just become accustomed too )  Last time when i mentioned bladder issues, i was sent to get xrays and mris done. ( i was kinda surprised how serious they take it ) But all they said was that there was a slight disc bulge or something, prescribed me some muscle relaxers, etc..   ...I'm wondering now if it was possibly misdiagnosed as that instead. I don't think they managed to actually get a proper MRI while i was there, as I had trouble remaining still whilst entubed. ( id try an relax and be still, then once the whirring started id jolt uncontrollably for some reason. )  I'm supposed to be setup to see a neurologist at some point, still waiting for that.   When i mentioned a possible mri to doc, she said ""Well there is no reason really for one, unless youve had some kind of tremendous thing occur to you that hits like a massive thunderbolt"" and some other jibber jabber that befuddled me.   ...I have to question this, as i mentioned before how when i mentioned bladder issues to another doc they sent me off to get one right away...  While there is probably more I could say, this is all i can manage for now.   Regards.","Chronic Pain , Headaches , Neck Pain , Migraines , Back Pain"

He has been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and ptsd from almost drowning when he was younger. He is taking prozak and seroquil which has helped his mood swings significantly, but we still have some really difficult days. He resists doing any chores, participating with the family in almost any way (having him eat dinner with us 2 times a week is a battle), etc. He has been making better friends and being more pleasant in his brief interactions with our family since being on his medicine steadily. (He went off his meds a few months ago, got violent, was paranoid, hit me and pulled a knife on me), but has not been violent other than when he went off his meds. When things are good he tells me he loves me very often. He has seemed appreciative of me sticking by his side through thick and thin for the most part, BUT when things don't go his way he very quickly will say horrible things like he wishes I was dead and won't appologize or take it back, He claims he means it. This has happened 4x. He also called me a C*NT yesterday for moving clothes in his room to move his new furniture (that he picked out and has known was coming for weeks) in. He had been asked to move the clothes with 2 days notice but hadn't and the movers wouldn't come in the room otherwise.

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/23016/no-outlet,No Outlet,"I have a situation it's seeming to get increasingly worse as time goes on. I've been to several different doctors about it and had all kinds of test done. In the end they pretty much all concluded the same thing. Starting about a year ago I got a pretty mild cough. I didn't think much of it, but as the months continued I started to get concerned. I went into the doctor and he dismissed it as some sort of bronchitis and gave me an inhailer. Skipping ahead with many doctors visits in between my symptoms have been getting worse. The cost remains the same, however I started getting random twinges, and tinglyness im pin pointed spots on my body. It would only happen occasionally so I didn't think it was really a huge deal, and only after I had drank the night before. Eventually I started noticing that I was having the twinges pretty consistently followed with mild panic attacks, night terrors and vague hallucinations. Now starting to feel a little crazy I went back to the doctor again and he did a blood test and some other test that I didn't really understand. A few days later I got a phone call saying the dr. had reviewed of the tests and everything looked fine to him. I went and got a second opinion with a different doctor and after a few visits and a blood test she concluded that it was anxiety. I am and always have been a very anxious and nervous person so that part made sense to me. However in the past I've tried a large variety of different medications and therapy techniques to help alleviate the anxiety but nothing has really worked. I felt for me it was best to handle it on my own with quite a bit of introspective thought. Now it is present day, I'm having all the same symptoms but magnified, sometimes ill randomly start seeing white lines, extreme dizziness, a weird pressure that I'm not exactly sure how to describe, followed by a really bizarre hum/crackling sound in my left ear, Breathless night terrors with hallucinations that last for several seconds after I woken up, and sometimes I have this weird feeling on my tongue but almost feels like there's a hair in my mouth but there isn't. It's gotten to the point where I'm starting to average three hours asleep or so at night if that. The weird tingly/spark feeling has a minor bit of a warm burn sensation to it, and my eye has been twitching, The muscles around it but also lights seem to have a flickig affect to them. I really don't know what to do here. Every doctor I've gone to has basically given me a similar answer, that it's just anxiety, but it feels like something more than that. I've always been very good at recapturing my breath and calming down anytime I feel like there's something similar to a panic attack but this feels different. Is it possible that it starts off as a little anxiety, and then the other symptoms slowly piggyback on lack of sleep or stress? I do like drinking but I have been trying to cut back on it especially with these health problems. I have an hour and a half commute one way every day on bumper to bumper traffic freeways, and family members in my past have had a history of dementia and a few cases of schizophrenia. I myself have been diagnosed as bipolar depressive. My dad just recently got diagnosed with dementia. The hallucinations when I first wake up we're pretty normal to me even as a kid. No there is this strange irrational wave of fear that comes with it, with also oddly A temporary inability to judge distance, for example I was laying in my bed and I couldn't tell how far it was from my mattress to the floor. It's also the fact that there starting to last longer, and are starting to happen in daylight when I've been awake for hours, along with all the other symptoms that is starting to really stress me out. If anyone has any helpfull advice or ideas please let me know. It's not 100% of the time that this is going on, It just seems like all of these symptoms have been slowly building and becoming worse over time and the doctors lack if response is starting to make me question my sanity a bit. In the end I would never do anything to hurt myself or someone else, but any advice anyone has that could help dim down the effects of it would be awesome.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression , Schizophrenia , Bipolar Disorder , Personality Disorders"

Small tics when young, now more frequent and pronounced facial twitches, to the point where it is affecting marriage. Tend to disappear when concentrating but get stronger before and after social situations. ------------------- I'm a 34 year old male, have a history of social anxiety and depression for which I have been medicated at various times. I don't get a lot of exercise but my diet is reasonable, I have one caffeinated drink a day on average, and have never smoked or done drugs. Now that I think back to my childhoood I realise I have always had tics of some sort, for want of a better word. When I was much younger I would make tiny grunting noises (not audible to those around me) and when I was older I developed a habit of clearing my throat, again very quietly so no one would notice. It never occurred to me to do anything about them as they didn't bother me or anyone else. A few years ago I noticed (as did a work colleague) that I had started squinting a lot. This disappeared after about a week, and resurfaced from time to time.  But it has started coming back more regularly and the squint has become a contortion of the entire right side of my face. It's extremely difficult to stop these rapid-fire twitches once they get going, but sometimes I can slow them down by taking deep breaths. It has reached the point where my wife is understandably embarrassed to be seen with me, so our marriage feels very shaky at the minute. Observations: * It tends to disappear when I'm concentrating on something, like drawing or trying to solve a problem at work.  * I can mostly keep it under control in social situations but will twitch like crazy before or after * I tend to always have some kind of tic, somewhere. When the twitching disappears it is normally replaced by some other compulsion, usually a slight throat-clearing, which has its own problems but I won't go into that here. * I tend to do it more at home than anywhere else * It tends to be worse in the afternoon and evening My doctor has put me on Nortriptyline 10mg, and I'm supposed to report back after a couple of weeks. The last time I went to him about this I was referred to CBT. I have been through CBT three times now, and it never seems to do anything.

Was medically discharged from service in 2005. I have had multiple MRI's and x-rays and all confirm DDD with multiple disc and nerve problems. I have also had at different times some injections that seem to give some relief. I have been through PT and chiropractor. I have been taking NASIDs and Tramadol 50mg(up to 3 times daily). This medication has helped relieve the pain to tolerable levels. I get all my medical care thru the VA health care system. I have moved regions and have a new Primary care team. Long story short, after requesting a new PCM, they changed my medications. They lowered the tramadol to once per day and put me on Diclofenac (twice daily). I was told that I do not have any reason to take the medications that worked before. The doctor wrote up that there was no need for this and the last MRI, 2016, showed this. I asked for another MRI and had one on Feb 1, 2018. I have about 6 MRIs that all show DDD. The last two MRIs do show the issues with my T-spine. I am happy to share my MRIs with the images to any professional that would give their opinion. I now have to deal with elevated pain levels that interfere with my daily life and happiness. I am not seeking narcotics. I would love to be pain free and off all medications. I understand that tramadol has been reclassified. I have been taking tramadol as directed for over ten years with great results. I have never abused it and many times I take less than the recommended dosage daily. My medical history shows that there are no concerns for medication abuse. I believe this is backlash for my request of a new PCM and the right up I did on the request for the reasons why I wanted to change PCM. I am not sure if I can upload documents here, but I can post the results from the MRIs in separate posts. I do have the images if there is a radiologist, neurologist, or ortho doctor that would take a look for me.  Thanks for any help and information.

The foot feels numb, there is pain in the bottom of the ankle when I walk (but it is not excruciating), and I can run but only flat-footed (which stresses the knees).

I am a single mother and raise my daughter on my own the best I can while suffering from depression and anxiety. I know I am a good mom when It comes to being loving support etc. but I know my mental issues prevent me from being a great mom sometimes to the point where I will cry and ask my nine-year-old am I a good mommy? When she goes to school or to visit family my purpose as a human being erases. I just try to sleep so I don't have to think about how empty my life is besides having my daughter. Any friends I had were from high school they weren't the best crowd to begin with but I am now down to no friends. I have isolated myself so much that sometimes I feel like high school was only a few years ago not 15. Some of my family who do not understand depression think I am lazy dramatic and like my current situation. I am none of those things and I hate my situation but then why don't I change it? I try but then become overwhelmed. Everything feels so overwhelming because I am always alone I feel like people don't understand how important social interaction is. When I stay secluded by yourself in the house alone for days at a time my mind becomes is so foggy. The littlest things like doing the dishes or doing laundry are impossible. It really doesn't make any sense because consciously I am a neat freak but if you walk in my house half the time you were think the oppisite. I go to a psychiatrist I am on medication it works to a certain extent but I still feel so debilitated. Another example is I have about five packages to return to The post office which is ONE block away they probably exceeded the 30 day return policy by now. What the hell is wrong with me? I always feel so socially awkward almost embarrassed to even walk around I look in the mirror and I don't know who I am anymore not only do I suffer from depression anxiety but also a skin condition called hidrainitis supprativa which makes me hibernate even more in the summertime because I can't take the heat it's too painful. There is a yoga class I have been wanting to go to so bad every Sunday around the corner I always make it a goal but I never go. I feel pathetic even writing this forum embarrassed that people will judge me and think I am just lazy. I know there is no magic answer but something has to change for the sake of myself and also my daughter. I am a very good loving person I will give you the shirt off my back but I don't treat myself with the same love I do other people.

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/21523/morning-depression-or-something-else,Morning Depression or something else?,"Background information: About a month ago, I started working out more intensely. Generally I don't get much of any exercise, but I decided to start running on the treadmill 2-3 times a day for ~10-15minutes at a time, along with crunches, pushups, etc.  After the first week my appetite declined, and I started eating far less than normal. I didn't notice because I was trying to lose weight anyway, and didn't think it would be that big of deal. After 2 weeks, I started experiencing some major problems which continued to get worse over the next week even after stopping all exercise. The problems include feeling depressed, fatigued, unmotivated to do much of anything, no appetite / nausea, and chills/sweats that last throughout the first half of the day. I also feel like I may have digestive issues as i'm going to the bathroom more often. On top of this, I'm having trouble sleeping throughout the night. I used to be a person who needed to sleep 8-12 hours a day to feel good. Now I end up waking up multiple times throughout the night, and never feeling like i'm fully rested and constantly in a fatigued/hazy/depressed state until the afternoon no matter how much i try to sleep.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- I went to the doctor, was almost prescribed anti-depressants but I've tried them in the past and they caused me some major problems, so the doctor instead decided to check my blood. A few days went by, got the results. Everything was more or less normal except my Vitamin B12 value was low at 211 ph/mL, so I was suggested to get a monthly B12 shot. (I have also been taking general Vitamins every day since I started feeling ""sick"" which also include B12) A few days have gone by, and I have not really noticed any large changes, and my problems have remained pretty consistent. Although last night I did experience a numbing/tingling sensation in my right hand a few times throughout the night. Not sleeping well, feeling awful/depressed all day until the mid-afternoon. It's weird though because in the afternoon, I feel normal again, my appetite returns, i feel good about myself, and regain interest in my various hobbies... -------------------------------------------------------------------- I've tried to do research on what I could possibly be going through... At this point I'm stumped. My main guesses are these: (1) ""Perhaps"" i caught a mild form of Mono, as my sister had it earlier this year. The blood test says I've been exposed, but ""Active"" mono is not present. (2) My B12 Vitamin count is too blame, and ""perhaps"" it just takes a long time to raise it up? (3) Some sort of anxiety/depression issue. I've always had mild/severe forms of anxiety/social anxiety, and a few episodes of depression. However, today I don't believe I have too many stresses that could cause something so severe and i'm heavily against taking anti-depressants as I had a horrible experience with them in the past. (4) Some sort of underlying sleep issue, I may try to record myself sleeping tonight and see if I sound strange (5) Perhaps some sort of stomach/digestion problem.  If you have any other guesses please let me know... Currently i'm on the fence.... either I try to wait it out a bit longer, or I go to the doctor again... and she will either put my on anti-depressants or run more tests. Both of which sound like they won't resolve my problem.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression , Eating Disorders"

Dealing with a developing anxiety disorder in itself was a difficult and draining battle, and on top of the typical adolescent problems of these years, I felt I was carrying a tremendous, heavy weight. I was extremely fortunate enough to have started treatment with an excellent adolscent psychiatrist who through behaviorial therapy and medications finally allowed me to prevail at this battle and live as an individual with GAD rather than GAD completely controlling my life. My 20's and 30's continued along a similar path of living as an individual with GAD rather than GAD completely running my life. School, work, marriage, kids, etc. But I am sure as anyone with GAD and it's many symptoms can understand, there are times when you just feel it. When the constant gnawing worry and self-critique and self doubt take hold stronger than other moments and you are reminded (even though you never actually forget) that there is something obviously different about you, even though you have become quite the master of portraying an even, 'normal' facade. So shortcut to my early 40's with schoolage kids, married, full time job and all the trimmings.. And tell myself I should be used to this by now, take this in stride now, and I can, most of the time.. But there are days and times where GAD symptoms come on with a strength and you feel so drained, so small. And I will go on, but there are still days where there is no forgetting/no fooling as to what can set you apart from those that surround you, when you feel alone and trapped in yourself, even when you are surrounded by loved ones.

These were pretty normal tension/stress/strain headaches with an occasional severe migraine thrown in. Until recently I called it a migraine if it did all of these: near blinding pain, nausea, vomitting, sensitivity to light, sound, hot, cold, motion, and not moving for too long and required a reclined position for relief, not standing or laying flat, and lasted for at least two doses of OTC migraine medicine. I now know that is far beyond what the definition of migraine states and have no idea what those are. About a year and a half ago, I suffered from more typical migraine type pain, but all over and two to four times daily, which meant I was overdoing it on medicine since they usually took one and a half to two full doses of OTC migraine meds to beat. This lasted almost exactly three months, so far no relapse, but now almost every headache I get lasts until medicated and takes two or more doses at the intervals on tge instructions. Most of these are not migraines, they are mild to moderate and impact my forehead, temples, neck, and vision centers on both sides of my head and are however accompanied by sensitivity to light, sound, hot and cold, and leaning over. I have searched for the combination of symptoms for all three of my worst headache types and have never been able to find a match.

I’ve never been a smoker before but I took the habit up because I stopped smoking weed. I’ve since moved to a Juul and smoke about a pod a day, easy. The leg pain comes when I start to smoke in the morning and about to when I go to bed. I work on my feet all day and am flat footed, and my stamina recently has been pathetic in bed and in general. I saw my PD and he said it’s probably a PT thing and sent me to a facility. It didn’t change anything. I don’t know if it’s caused by smoking and I have like Beurgers disease or something, but it’s to the point where I have to stretch my calves an hour into my shift. And sit whenever I get the chance. My right leg is the worse and it feels weaker and weaker each day that passes. Also, I have very itchy dry skin on my right shin that is red an discolored I have scratched it so much. This was also happening by my ankle and top of my foot three years prior to even smoking so not sure what that is caused by... there’s a lot going on but just wanna know if anyone is going through anything similar or if anyone has answers.

I was wondering if anybody could tell me what I experienced last night. As a teenager in a highly competitive school, I have been very stressed lately and it has already shown on my physical health.  However, last night when I was about to sleep my brain just switched into thinking thoughts that I could not control. I can not precisely recall what thoughts they were but I do remember that I was terrified and they were the thoughts I constantly tried to oppress. Naturally, I tried to oppress the thoughts I had but they were too strong and I could not think clearly of doing anything but lie of my bed and shake and try to count numbers. I felt like I was going insane and if I had let my thoughts through I might have gone insane for real.  Nevertheless I do not think that this might be a panic attack as I did not have any physical discomforts during the attack but rather a strong mental switch. I am really concerned about this as I doubt I will be able to control and repell it next time if it ever occurs again.  Thanks in advance.",Anxiety & Panic Disorders

Background: About 10 mos ago while playing volleyball, I dove for the ball and my leg was in front of me and jammed while the rest of my body followed and kind of crunched together. Immediately I had an excruciating, sharp pain in my lowest back, near the tailbone- that pain where you almost pass out. I could not walk- my left leg just gave out. My friends carried me to the playground and I hung from the monkey bars while they pulled on my legs. Whatever slipped out, seemed to slip back in and it was nearly instant relief. It still ached, but it was completely fine by the next day.  Then 2 days ago, I was playing and I felt a twinge on my left side in the same place but there was no dive or moment I can pinpoint- it just started to hurt gradually and the pain spread to the rest of my lower back. I stopped playing and went swimming, hoping that would help, but by the time I got home, I could barely walk. The pain is unbearable and I can't bend over at all or sit or stand or do anything- even lying on the floor is uncomfortable. I can only lie on my side with a pillow in between my knees. I've done nothing but stay in bed for two days. I have an appointment with the doctor tomorrow and the pain has gotten slightly better, but it still constant and intense. I can't sleep and I have terrible reactions to pain meds so I have minimal relief options other than NSAIDs and xanex.  Here's the reason I'm posting: The pain still feels MOSTLY on my left side, very lower back, but there is no shooting pain down my leg, and only moderate hip tightness. The strange thing that I can't seem to find anything about is this weird thing that happens when walking- the point where my left foot starts to leave the ground, I immediately get this sharp, acute pain in my left back and near by tailbone. I feel something shift/slip near by tailbone and left side of my lower back. It's such a creepy, strange feeling- something should not be moving or sliding around. Pain does not shoot up my leg- as soon as that foot leaves the ground, it triggers pain like pressing a button and I want to collapse, the pain is so sharp and intense. I can't find anything online about this- everything talks about sacroiliac hip/sciatic nerve pain, but I have no pain down my leg and it's closer to my tailbone than my hip. Just wondering if anyone knows anything about this. I am so worried I'm going to be immobile for the rest of the summer and I may lose my mind.",Back Pain

I just joined, and this is my first post because I've seen to have been getting nothing but dismissive responsive for every doctor I've seen regarding this issue, and it's a very crippling issue to endure - I basically can not function normally throughout any given day due to this strange, scary pain that occurs on my left side neck/shoulder, in the ""pocket"" space where your neck and shoulder meet. I've been experiencing this pain since September of 2017, and have been dealing with it for about a year now, obviously. The pain is triggered by any one of these certain events, and those events are as follows: increased heart rate, heavy breathing, heightened pulse, use of left arm when lifting something heavy, deep breath all the way in, heightened blood pressure (like when entering a hot shower), having sex, especially as I reach closer to orgasm, and a few other events that I can't quite think of at the moment. The pain can be described as a ""pulse"" pain, that occurs WITH my pulse, as if a vein, nerve, or blood vessel is being compressed, and it's a strange, sharp, stinging pain that I can't quite describe other than what it might feel like to have your pulse hurt. The pain itself is about a 7 out of 10, but it's a 10/10 in its crippling effect; after it happens, I continue to have anxiety about it for pretty much the remainder of the day, and general anxiety about it even when it doesn't happen because I know it will happen when I do any of the things that trigger it. Since December of 2018, I've basically been regulating my heart rate and breathing so that I don't feel the pain - it only occurs for a few seconds, but my GOD is it crippling. Regulating my breathing and actions include things like resting at every landing after climbing stairs so that I don't exert too much energy, holding my breath when bending over to pick up something, or limiting my breath capacity allllll day, so that I never inhale too much air, which potentially triggers the pain, either because of lung expansion, or heart rate increase - I'm not sure which. Another thing, which may be unrelated, is that the same region where the pain occurs seems swollen or bigger than the other side, but I'm right handing and typically do everything with my right hand and right side, so there's no real reason why the muscle should be bigger on the left side than on my right. I've had CT scans, MRIs, XRays, and carotid Doppler, and nothing has been found yet. I've even had massages and chiropractic work - the chiropractic work seemed to cure it completely for about a week, then it came back again in full force. Another thing that may be related is that when I breathe very deeply, or when I'm reeaaalllyyy full from eating, there's a slight pain in my shoulder, somewhat near the area where I experience this pain, but it's not the same kind of pain. Feels like maybe a nerve is being pressed or something along those lines, which can only be associated with the fact that my stomach is very full, thus pushing other organs up and around etc, ultimately causing something up there to be pressed - like I said, I'm not sure if it's related. Before I continue, I'd like to hear some responses as to what you all might thing it is, and also what kind of specialist might I need to see to find out what it is, and what kind of tests should I seek, etc Age: 30 years old Height: 5'10"" Weight: 188lbs I'll continue to provide as much information as I can to anyone who asks, and I certainly appreciate the help of the WebMD community.

I am hoping at some point I can get the courage to get decent help or gain some tools to get some relief. I need some non judgmental advice and reassurance. I need something.  There are several things that trigger my anxiety but after my father had a heart attack and passed away I was able to push my anxieties away for a couple years but after about 6 years (it has been about 10 years now) I could barely function when my mother or my (now) husband doesn't answer their phone, i am to the point where I have to make sure they are breathing when they are sleeping. My father had a heart attack in front of me and I had no clue what to do to help him at the time. As I look back I know that if I were to administer CPR he would be probably here today. I know this is definitely a factor in my panics with my family members now and I cant seem stop the horrifying worry.  Even after these events I didn't have a problem with changes in my life, such as changing jobs or things of this nature. Now when there is a change like this I can't hold my emotions. I feel that basically life is over, I cant stop thinking about how temporary life is and is this even worth it because it may just end soon or at least eventually. I get so emotional I just cry and cant stop my mind from thinking about all the negative things about life.  I am also petrified to become a parent. I have no worries about childbirth at all. Its the change involved with parenting. I am so in love with my husband i never want that to end (another worry I have) I am ashamed to say that I was pregnant and had to terminate due to anxiety (Only my mother knows this). I felt like I couldn't function, I couldn't eat, sleep or even think clearly. I would have panic attacks through out the day and could barely breathe. I went to see a therapist during this time and only felt judged more. I am so ashamed of myself.  My husband wants children and I only want him to be happy I am trying so hard to get better at handling my anxiety and worries but it just keeps coming back. I make mistakes reading about child rearing and only see bad stories. I know at this point its all I notice because that is my worry but it puts me in a bad place again.  On the flip side of this I have so many happy moments in my life also, I get so excited thinking about a future with my husband and traveling and I try to imagine having children and just enjoying life. Then I see someone post an article on facebook about how it basically ruined their life to have kids and then I am back to where I think I am doomed because I cant handle the change. Every time I state some of these fears to people I just get the  "" stop worrying"" ""just push it away"" ""everything will be fine""  I need to hear about people who were able to overcome this horrible thing called anxiety.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression"

Tramadol,"If you have ever experienced extended periods of difficulty in taking on the day or a general need to drink alcohol to ""relax' or deal with life, you may want to read this as my life has changed dramatically. I'm sharing this, not to give advice, but I think it's important to share as I sort through what to do next. When I was younger (ages 15-18 and ages 23-28) I often experienced suicidal feelings. The depth of these issues went away with a spiritual awakening (I won't share my faith as that is not my intent here) but I still had issues with depression that made is very difficult to take on the day and to be effective at my job. I thought this was ""normal"". Life was just hard. I would often drink to get drunk, often drinking heavily after my family went to bed. I was, in essence, self medicating. Sometimes I couldn't wait for everyone to go to bed so I could watch a good movie and pour myself stiff drinks.  In addition, I would sometimes take Oxycotin, as this was given a while back when I had surgery. I would take it (abuse it), not to deal with physical pain, but to get to a better mental place, again, typically at night when things were quiet. The feeling was that of being placed in a ""cocoon"", protected from any worries for a few hours. My life wasn't being managed well. Even though I made a lot of money, we were on the verge of not being able to pay our mortgage. I just wasn't handling life very well. I would argue with my wife often and was very sensitive to her comments. I would get anxiety in large crowds. I didn't like meeting new people as I didn't trust them. I would often feel guilty with how I handled things with my kids, often overreacting (this may have been due to lack of good sleep due to drinking).   Yes, a wide array of issues. Exercise and good eating never really solved the problem. Then, in dealing with some knee issues, I was given Tramadol. This drug removed the cloud in my head. I did not feel high, rather, I felt very productive. I felt optimistic. I no longer had feelings that could easily be hurt. I felt little to no desire to drink or take Oxycontin because both would impair me. Tramadol did not. I felt more social and would engage other people. My work improved greatly and I was able to not only handle my day job very effectively (getting perfect reviews at work) but I also held three side consulting jobs that have us just crushing our debt.  I now take 50mg of Tramadol about once per day and do I it primarily to remove the useless anxiety and worry I once felt. I'm honestly a better husband and dad. I deal with problems head on, but they don't feel like problems, rather challenges. I feel... normal, like this is how life is supposed to be.  I have read that there are better options for people like me, other drugs. I have always been one who is against the use of drugs (I actually liked it when Tom Cruise laid into Matt Lauer stating that there is a 'better way' than using pills). That being said, truth is truth, and the truth is that Tramadol has eliminated what I think is the root issue of many of my problems. I'm not saying this is the ultimate or best answer, but I am saying that for the first time in my life, I feel like an weight has been taken off my back. I look forward to the future and achieving my goals taking on challenges.  So, what's next? I don't know but I thought this was worth sharing. I don't know the long-term effects of taking 50mg of Tramadol a day is, but that will be my next step - to find out.  Thanks for reading.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression , Substance Abuse"

The last couple of years is in a academy where the students are individually tutored. They've kept her schedule light (number of classes) as not to overwhelm her. She has a couple more years before she's finished. The classes are are on-line and she has 6 months to finish from the day she starts at which time she is working with the tutor. The only reason she can go to the academy is because of an inheritance.  Even with the help of everyone involved (weeks before the end date) she recently didn't finish 2 classes which she now has to retake (not to mention the costs $$). This is not the first time this has happened. She gave me all kinds of excuses when I asked her to do the work. She is scheduled to go on a teen retreat (yoga mind body ..etc) which she loves and is great for her mentally .. do we let her go or punish her (not let her go) because she didn't finish her classes. The retreat is out of state .. she has to fly.  The above is just one example. I cannot be the only parent (ok my husband too) who has trouble deciding when to punish your teenage without the fear of them hurting themselves and/or going into a depression. She has but herself in the past although it's been on the decline.  BYW ... she inherited the depression from me... I know what it's like to be in the deep black hole.  So for your parents ... what to do you ?  Thanks so much.,"Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression"

So, let me start this journey. Let me go back to when I was about 12 to 13. I know I was still in middle school. My dad and I were out shopping and my dad grabbed my neck to try to scare me, but he notice that my spine connect to my neck was very large. My godmothers husband is a chiropractor, so my dad decided to go get x-rays done. He told me that my spine is completely straight. Didn’t think much of it. I wasn’t in pain at all at the time. Fast forward to about 15, I started getting muscle spasms regularly. To the point, at the end of the day I’m crying alone in my room. Not letting anyone know how much pain I am. Over the years until about 17, it was just annoying and occasional would be in bed crying. When I got about 17, I would crying every night. Losing sleep, had to be on the phone or watching some sort of movie I have watched over and over again to try to at least ease it. Around that time or at 18, I went to the doctor and I got prescribed ibuprofen because they believed it was period pain. So I took that, didn’t help much unless I was super distracted and only during the day. But at night time, completely different ball field. I took so much ibuprofen over the next two to three years. I started pooping blood. So I went to urgent care and they prescribed tramadol which made me feel like I just took a sugar tablet.  And then went back to annoying and coming back occasionally. So when i was late 22, it all started coming back. Taking naproxen and using the heating pad, shower or bath, (which I have done both of those the whole time) and that helped to get me to sleep for awhile. Now for the past nine to six months, I will have to fight back tears almost every night because I feel like I am baby for crying. I try all the things I usually do, but to no avail. During the day, it feels like it needs to be cracked constantly. I will have relief for a few minutes and then back to where we started. So, now I’m stilling here at 3 in the morning. I can’t get comfortable, and I just want to cry. I just wat to know if I am just crazy, overrating, or what to do? I just feel like no one believes the extent of what pain I am in. I try to hide as much as I can. But there are so many more symptoms but I can go into that later.  Any help will be great.","Chronic Pain , Neck Pain , Medication , Back Pain"

Since that time I have been saddled with chronic pain and nerve damage to the left thigh area and toes of both feet. My back, hips and knees are filled with arthritis. I was prescribed and have been using various strengths of slow and instant release Morphine and Gabapenten for pain and nerve damage, as well as over-the-counter pain meds, Zopiclone for insomnia, Atacand to assist in lowering the upper blood pressure level, Rosuvastatin for colesteral and Wellbutrin for anxiety.  This past weekend I was volunteering at a local event where various companies set up booths to advertise, promote and sell some of their products. One of the booths was set up by a company called ""Twisted Extracts"" who's main product is CBD cannabis oil and other CBD products. A few years ago I was referred to a Physical Medicine specialist who, after a thorough workup, prescribed medical cannabis for pain management and sleep but I have never used the prescription as I had tried recreational marijuana before and thought that I would have the same experience with the medical type. I didn't realize it until someone explained the difference between medical and recreational marijuana, and I didn't want the feeling of being high all the time.  Anyway, I purchased some CBD gummies and something called Twisted Extracts Cara-Melts which is just another type of CBD candy. The gummies are 80mg each and you are supposed to be able to easily cut them into 8 - 10mg doses. The Cara-Melts are 70mg per dose. I really would like to to try them to see if they would be of some value in managing my pain and then possibly reducing or eliminating some of these heavy medications.  To get to the point and my question, I'm wondering if I try them, should I use it in place of the meds while testing out or along with the prescription medications?  Any assistance that you could offer would be greatly appreciated. Thanks","Knee Pain , Chronic Pain , Headaches , Medication , Back Pain"

My problem is, I would wake up in the morning feeling not at all rested, even though I had gotten 7-8 hours of sleep; the only time i could feel i was getting some rest was if i closed my eyes shut using my palm or my fingers! As a temporary solution, for the past few years I've been wearing a sleep mask, which I would fold and twist so as to cause at least partial pressure to my eyes, and that seemed to work! What I'm worried about, however, is that this constant pressure might cause me other eye problems down the line! Has anyone heard of something like this in the past? PS: This might be irrelevant, but when I was growing up my bed was directly across from the hall light, which we left open during the night. Maybe that had something to do with it, I don't know.

Long story short, I have gotten myself into a huge problem: After moving out of my parent's house at 18, which was emotionally traumatizing, I was really depressed. I would feel okay some days, but would get depressed easily and would be irritable too. It was an emotional roller coaster, so as a young and naive 18 yr old, I started seeking answers of what could be wrong, disregarding the fact that it was a normal response to the circumstances I was experiencing.  But in this search I came across bipolar disorder, and being someone who had no idea the severity of what ""mania"" and ""hypomania"" were, it made sense and seemed to explain what I was feeling. So at 19, a little over a year after moving out of my parents house, I moved to a different state for college and I began seeing a psychiatrist for my possible problem that I pretty much originally self-diagnosed. I told her my concerns and she went with it, diagnosing me within five minutes. At the time it made so much sense and it gave me an explanation for what I was feeling and what had happened to me. Now fast forward to today, I am over 20 yrs old and know that I do NOT have bipolar disorder. I was 18, hurt, and confused. I wanted answers and tried to answer them in a very damaging way. The predicament I am in now is I have absolutely no idea how to fix this. I am no longer seeing the original psychiatrist because of insurance issues, my second psychiatrist moved practice, and I have yet to see the third. I also have a year of mental health issues on my records which DRASTICALLY impedes the job I want. I also am terrified of what will happen because of my records and the only medical issues I know are 100% accurate is ADD and poor diet/exercise. I don't know how to approach someone to fix this without appearing like I just want off my meds/manic and have something bad added to my ""psychotherapy notes."" The most important thing is I just want to be able to move forward with my life. Please, if anyone has advice I would really appreciate it. I do have access to lawyers if necessary.

Sleep,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sleep/2635/narcolepsy,Narcolepsy,"Narcolepsy symptoms are so much more than is often written in outdated textbooks and many blogs etc. On-line. Also, that we are exhausted during the day because we don't get restorative sleep at night and why we don't sleep at night.  While the actual cause is debated between genetic and/or auto-immune, t one of the top specialists in North America on sleep (and Narcolepsy) holds the position from his research that it is genetic. Not a pre-disposition but a genetic illness like CysticFibrosis. Although narcolepsy symptoms may begin to occur anywhere from infancy to adulthood. Often misdiagnosed by physicians and self diagnosis alike as insomnia or poor sleep habits etc.  Most people do not get the 7-9 hours sleep recommended for healthy individuals. So actually getting referred to a sleep lab twice is unusual as it is fluffed off as ""who isn't tired?"" The first lab is to rule out sleep apnea among other sleep disorders and second to rule out Narcolepsy (where in addition to sleeping overnight, one is to take 4 naps all of which I fell asleep in under a minute after 8 hours of sleeping the previous night).  This lab test shows the way Narcolepsy sleep patterns function.  In a non-narcoleptic sleep cycle the person will fall asleep without much trouble though it may take about 15-20 minutes. Then once asleep they will reach REM sleep in approximately 4hours. Then they will slowly cycle up toward a wakened state but never very close. Throughout the night they will head down into REM slightly sooner then the sleep cycle prior and sooner and sooner as the night progresses. We dream in REM sleep though don't recall these dreams as REM is reached more gradually than in Narcoleptics. Many people surprisingly say they don't dream. They do. It simply means that they don't remember dreaming. For those of you who remember dreaming it is in the early morning as our sleep cycles shorten and reaching REM becomes quickest. Wakefulness and Dreaming often blend together and we remember dreams that were most likely only seconds but felt like hours.  For Narcoleptics, we reach our first REM in under one minute and wake up and these cycles repeat all night long. Creating confusion between what is a dream and what is real, causing terrifying night terrors, sleep paralysis and many other things.  For example I will reach for a drink of water, fall asleep while still holding the glass, dream that what's in my hand is something else and drop it all over me, the bed and the floor. I try to stay awake to clean up the mess and fall asleep and wake up on the other side of my room.  So, there are pharmaceuticals that can help us to try and stay asleep ""fake sleep"" and meds that try and keep us awake during the day ""fake awake"". Never do we ever achieve actual restorative sleep.  Think of when you missed one nights sleep, does your brain function well the next day? No! You may experience blurry vision, social or other anxiety and many other hindrances. Narcoleptics describe as I have, double vision, confusion, hallucinations and always a desire to sit at least if not lye down to avoid falling over. (Btw never enough seats provided in public places.) It is one of several ""invisible"" illnesses where people say you look well, while inside you are feeling horrible.  People also say ""Oh, I get tired too!"" Which may come from an empathetic place though Narcolepsy is much more than being tired. The truth is even when we tell someone that we have Narcolepsy, most people just stare at you because most people don't know what it is.  So my end point to this long message if you made it here is to never judge others. We just don't have all the facts to make those assumptions. Also if you have experienced trouble sleeping for more than 2 weeks see a doctor and ask for a referral to a sleep lab.  I went to rule out sleep apnea and discovered this. My whole life now made sense and I got some help to really improve my life.","Apnea , Sleep Paralysis , Insomnia , Sleepwalking , Nightmares"

I usually have to write down what I need to say and I have it in front of me or I will start stuttering on the phone.  I struggle to make eye contact with people, even with my own mother…I do try to make an effort to make eye contact with people, but it’s really uncomfortable and my eyes are always darting about. Today I was in the supermarket and I wanted to by a 24 pack of cans, I went to put them in my basket and employee asked me I wanted him to leave it at a till for me, I said “yes please” and continued with my shopping. When I went to pay the cans were not on any of the tills, so I just went to grab another one instead, but that same employee was still near the display; I didn’t want to grab another one and I didn’t want to ask him about them. I don’t know why, and I know that if I had been with a friend or my mum they wouldn’t have hesitated to ask for me.  Instead I just grabbed a 6 pack of a different drink, paid and left quickly, hoping that employee wouldn’t see me leaving without them as I would have felt even more awkward and embarrassed (It wasn’t busy and I wasn’t exactly dressed inconspicuously, in my bright green hoodie and purple cap). I got in the car and just started crying…It wasn’t a case of “I didn’t get the drink I wanted so now I’m upset” it was more like “What the *** is wrong with me?”",Anxiety & Panic Disorders

I never had any wrist problems until about 2 days ago. I noticed when I bent my right wrist (the hand I use my mouse with) all the way to the left, my wrist would really hurt. When I bend it to the right, not so much, but I still feel pain. I know of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome as it is very common among gamers, but it says that the main symptoms are numbness in the fingers, but I fully feel my hand, and my wrist doesn't even hurt when I leave it in a neutral position, it is only until I bend it left that it starts to hurt. I also have my mouse in a pretty low position, so I can see why my wrist would hurt because I have to kind of bend it upwards. I really hope this doesn't develop into CTS. Thanks for any help! For now I'm trying to use my mouse less and at least elevate my arm by using the mouse on the upper portion of my desk (which I notice it relieves the bending pressure).",

I and slightly over weight from taking an antidepressant 2 years ago. I have had extreme pain for the last 3+ years. It is my lower back, hips, groin, and leg pain. I have seen a total of 13 doctor's; general doctor's, spine surgeons, hip surgeons, pain management doctor, nerologists, and rhematologists. I have been partially diagnosed with random issues that aren't adding up to anything. I have fibromyalgia, uneven hips, scoliosis from the uneven hips, and a labral tear in my left hip. I was told at one point that I was over weight which is causing the pain, and to get on a bike to lose weight, I was then told by the next doctor if I get on a bike it would get significantly worse. I try to workout or exercise by walking, running, yoga, and basic weight lifting, all of these cause more pain. I can barely walk the day after working out and I don't even push myself that hard.  I am having the worst pain in my lower back and right hip. On my worst days my pain is a 9 and I can't move, I have numbness and tingling down my legs. My right leg has nerve pain from my groin all the way down to the top of my foot. I have most recently seen a hip surgeon who is refusing to fix the tear in my hip because he isn't sure that is what's causing all of this pain. He is saying my case is too complicated. He just gave me an injection in my left hip which was supposed to numb it. It is creating more pain in my lower back making it more difficult to walk.  I am tired of dealing with all of this pain, I have taken every type of anti inflammatory, gel rub anti inflammatory, and physical therapy for 2 years. I am currently taking tramadol at a low dose, which is barely getting rid of the pain. I have had xrays, MRI's, MRI's with contrast, and ultra sounds. The only information they got was my hips are uneven, and the slight tear in the left hip.  I can't even work, this pain is making it so I can barely get of bed, let alone drive to work and stay there 8 hours for a shift. I just recently had to leave my job because I was in so much pain. I am wondering if anyone knows anything or can recommend a doctor/specialty to go to besides a pain management. Please help!

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/12289/son-with-serious-mental-health-issues,Son With Serious Mental Health Issues,"Our 25-year-old son has been experiencing depression, anxiety, PTSD, flashbacks and nightmares for the past 2+ years. My father molested his older brother about 23 years ago about one or two times. Our older son told us what happened a few years afterwards, and we did what was needed legally and that son received counseling and we had family counseling for several years. The younger son was about 2 years old at the time. I had cut all contacts with my father after that. In 2011 I got a call from his sister-in-law that lived close that he had fallen, was in the hospital and diagnosed with a concussion and dementia. I had to unfortunately reconnect with my father (I am his only child and my mother passed away in 2000) and get him into an assisted living facility and ultimately a VA nursing home where he died in December 2014. We as a family would occasionally visit him and take him on outings until the dementia became worse. This renewed contact with my father brought up repressed memories in our younger son that he was forced to watch what my father did to our older son, hit the younger son with a belt and told him he was ugly. Our younger son has since been hospitalized for suicidal depression and severe anxiety 3 times, is on multiple medications and is getting therapy. About once per week he will have nightmares and flashbacks that are really bad. He has not been able to work for the past 2 years, has no money, (applied for SSD in 2015 through an attorney but was denied and waiting for a hearing) so begs us to buy him 4 Lokos, which is a drink with 14% alcohol. He says that is the only way he gets through the after affects of these episodes as the medications (Xanax, clonodine, prozak and hydroxezine) do not help. We have all his medications in a locked safe and he does not know the combination. We put out the proper doses of his meds at the proper times. When he has the alcohol, he does not get and knows he should not have the xanax. I am sorry for the long dramatic post, but need to ask a question. Are we helping him through this difficult period in his life and these serious flashbacks and nightmares by buying him the alcohol? We have been afraid to tell his psychiatrist for fear no more controlled substances will be prescribed. His current medications seem to be helping most of the time, except when he has these flashback and nightmares. His psychiatrist has increased doses several times but they continue. He has started a new therapy called EMDR with his counselor and we are praying that will help. After the flashbacks and nightmares he is obviously very upset - shaking, sweating, depressed, etc. He claims the coping skills he has been taught do not help at these times. I am just looking for some support and opinions on members who may have experienced similar experiences. Thank you very much.",

They estimated him to die 2 months ago but he is still doing pretty well. When he first went on hospice he was on low dose oxycodone and low morphine. As his pain got worse they took him completely off the oxycodone and kept raising the mg on his morphine till he is now on 100mg tablets and liquid morphine. The morphine is not enough he is still in bad pain in his private areas. They raised his mg so fast (and it still not working) that he really doesn't have any further to go except getting it in a IV which of course they want him in the hospice home. (I believe they thought he would be dead now so they just kept giving more morphine and his still not comfortable as he should be). I cannot understand why they raised the morphine so much so quick without trying to up the mg on his oxy. Now that it is 2 months past his death date and he is still trying to walk around the house and enjoy what he can, they added methadone to his morphine regimen. Since then he is confused and cannot swallow properly. My question is, how can taking methadone (that is suppose to block opiods) and strong morphine help with his pain? Would that not stop the morphine from doing its job as a whole? Would it not be better to add the oxy back and get him off the methadone.

Baker's Cyst, Torn Meniscus, and Small Fracture causing bruising on bone in knee","On Memorial Day I was walking outside and I heard a loud pop in my knee and I hit the ground. I could not get up and had to call for help. I went to the ER and was told that I had a Baker's Cyst in my knee and that it might have ruptured. I was told to see my regular doctor and get an ultra sound of my knee. I did and they told me that yes I did have a Baker's Cyst and it was 5 cm. I was made an appointment with the ortho doctor. Went to see the ortho doctor and was told on Baker's Cyst all they do is watch them. However, there had to be an underlying problem to get the cyst in the first place. Got a shot in my knee and ended up going the next week to get a mri of the knee. The mri showed that I have a torn meniscus, the Baker's Cyst, and a small fracture which has caused bruising on a bone. The ortho doctor told me to stay off my leg for 6 weeks and then return. That was 1 week ago and the pain is awful. I take aleve for the pain and it helps a little. I do not like the way that pain medicines make you feel and they make me do stupid stuff so I prefer not to take them. What can I do about the pain and after the 6 weeks, will the torn meniscus be healed or what will they do about that. Please I need answers!",

Just wanted to reply to some questions you posed in a recent post that was deleted (thank you moderators!). I am doing OK, but the past two years have been extremely stressful for our family. Our younger son has serious mental health issues and is being treated and making good progress. My wife's mom needed care at the beginning of 2016 so my wife had to move in with her and be her care giver. Mom did not live far, only about a 7-10 minute drive so we visited a lot. I took care of our home here, our two sons and the pets while she was at her mom's house taking care of her. Mom passed away on 4/19/17 at the age of 92. She had multiple heath problems, and was kidney dialysis since the end of 2015.  I handled things pretty well, but I have bipolar disorder and was in manic phase most of the time my wife was away. I worked with my primary doctor and tried lamitrogine, then depakote. The depakote was helping for a while, but made my blood glucose soar (I have type 2 diabetes) and gain wait while still eating a healthy diets. Turns out both of these are known side affects of depakote. The depakote startedl becoming less effective so with my doctor's guidance I weaned off for a few weeks and stopped. All my numbers look great when I have blood work, but I am manic again. I may speak to my doctor soon, or may go ahead and see a psychiatrist to try and find a medication that helps me but with less side affects. My wonderful wife would certainly appreciate me being a bit less wild. :) I have started coming to the WebMD message boards again and love the new format. Sorry about the cyber bullying you are experiencing here, but enough of us know how wonderful your support is and appreciate your contributions very much. The moderators seem to be handling things perfectly. Blessings, -Dave",

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/14203/depression-and-self-hatred,Depression and Self Hatred,"I truly realized that I was depressed about two years ago. At this time, I had just graduated from college, gotten hired for my first full time job, moved back to my home town, and found out that I was pregnant. Two weeks before I was to start my full time job, I had an abortion. I didn't really think about it at the time, I just felt that I had to do it. It had a very devastating effect on me, but I tried to go through the motions as best I could. I started seeing a counselor about three months later and was diagnosed with an adjustment disorder. I saw the counselor for about a year, and I feel like she and time really did help me come to terms with the abortion. I went from thinking about it constantly to rarely, but I am still very depressed a majority of the time. I think I have been for almost my whole life. I have tried to do the things that I think a happy and successful person would do, and over the past couple years I have flourished at my job, since moved on to a better and higher paying job, gotten engaged to my boyfriend of almost 10 years, gotten my own dog, etc. But every day is a huge struggle, and I just feel like my brain has never wanted happiness for me. I basically have no close friends in my life, and I notice that I am a critical and judgmental person especially towards myself and have always been this way. I constantly dwell on the mistakes or possible mistakes I've made at work, the conversations I've had in which I'm sure I've said something stupid, and the things I could have done ""better"" in my life. I have tried very hard to change, but I always come back towards being negative. I am finding it impossible to continue to live like this, because I see no future for myself. I am also afraid of making my fiancé's life miserable once we get married (my negativity often manifests itself by my being critical of him). He knows about my struggles and has been insanely supportive, and this is what truly convinced me that marrying him was the right choice. However, I don't think he understands the extent of my self hatred, and I feel like it becomes worse every day. Anyway, I am looking for some advice on what to do because I have no idea where to turn. This just feels like an impossible obstacle to overcome. Thank you.",Depression

I cannot stop thinking and when I go to school I cannot concentrate no matter how hard I try because there is a loud voice in my head (My own voice, not a strange or unknown voice) just thinking and thinking all day long. I have actually failed two quizzes now because it is so hard for me to listen in the classroom...I woke up one morning and asked myself a simple question, and I came up with two possible answers and from those two answers I came up with more questions, and more possible answers and it just continues throughout the day until I go to sleep. Then I wake up the next day and remind myself where I left off in my thought process, and I continue my train of thought. It is starting to scare me because it distracts me from school and a few of my grades have dropped because I cannot stop thinking about these crazy topics. I am an 18 year old high school student and I suffer from anxiety. I tried researching what this could be and I found a lot of anxiety related answers, but those answers described overthinking things and worrying about things, but my thinking processes are not worrisome. My boyfriend asked to see what one of my thought processes was like, so here is an example of a message that I sent him, which is what I was thinking at that moment he asked me: ""You know how we are a physical embodiment of our souls? And people usually consider their physical appearances a big part of their personality? Like the things we wear, piercings, tattoos, and what we do with our hair. That's only a small aspect of our personality, so who are we with out our physical appearances? What does our inner being consist of? Do my opinions make me who I am? In the controversy of abortion, I am pro choice. So is being pro choice a part of who I am? I don't think so because that is an opinion that I have about something in the physical world. If that controversy never existed, who would I be then? Do my values make me who I am? I value my friends and my well being. Does that make me who I am? I don't think so because those are basic human values. I think our inner being consists of something that makes us unique from every other inner human being. If we eliminate all physical properties and all that is left is our souls, then who is my soul and how is it different from everyone else's soul? What if I have it all wrong? What if all of our souls are exactly the same and it is up to the individual to create his/her own unique being? If this was true, then should we be okay with the bad people in this world? For example murderers, they want to be murderers so why would we stop someone from being who they want to be? (I know this sounds horrible, but complete open mindedness is necessary for this topic. I do not agree with murder, this is just for the sake of this example.) But murderers are a product of our society. People are oppressed, abused, or traumatized and become murderers. So in this government, we create murderers and then throw them in jail as punishment for doing something that they found pleasure in. People think that there is only one criminal and one victim, but actually, the murderer is also a victim. A victim of this government. This government is the real criminal (for turning its own citizens to into horrible people), and the prisoners are the victims (because they are bad due to a crappy government) Many prisoners are actually very smart people, and sometimes that is why they are in prison! They are a threat to the government so they find a stupid reason to put the smart people in jail. Smart people end up dying in cells every day. Smart people actually live miserable lives because they know too much about the real world. Smart people are smart enough to realize that being smart isnt all that fun, because you know things that you dont want to know.."" This train of thought continued for about 6 hours and by the end of the night i found myself talking about the multiverse theory. Let me remind you that this started off with the questioning what an inner being consists of and led me to the multiverse theory. It happens consistently and even when I am talking to someone, I cannot concentrate on what they say because my mind is too distracted with this thinking. It has come to the point where I get horrible headaches every night and the thinking still doesn't stop and it is starting to worry me. My boyfriend said that I showed incredible analysis and critical thinking but I am actually scared of this and I want it to calm down. Has this happened to anyone else? Is this a mental disorder?

One of our most popular treatment programs is for TMJ (Temporomandibular Joint) disorders. You may be wondering what a TMJ disorder even is. Surprisingly, approximately 12% of people in the United States will experience TMJ disorders in their lifetime. TMJ tends to affect more women than men and can be commonly associated with symptoms of jaw pain or an unusual popping or clicking of the jaw while talking or eating. Those affected by TMJ will most often note the restriction of jaw movement which can cause severe discomfort. Some individuals may experience a subset of TMJ symptoms including head or back aches, migraines, and ear issues like buzzing, ringing, numbness, or pain that may spread to the cheeks. The TMJ connects the mandible (lower jaw) to the temporal bone (skull). Likewise, specific key muscles used for chewing are attached to the mandible and may become sore with a TMJ disorder. It is difficult to attribute TMJ disorders to any one cause. Moreover, TMJ disorders may be caused by: grinding or clenching of teeth while sleeping, physical injury, arthritis, dental surgery, autoimmune diseases, infections, environmental, genetic, or hormonal factors. Luckily, TMJ disorders are common and can be treated at home or by one of our professionals at CardioFlex Therapy. We recommend you first try some simple, lifestyle changes to possibly correct the concern. It all breaks down to rest: if you reduce movement and rest the jaw, changes may occur. We recommend you avoid chewing gum & tensing your jaw. Try to eat soft foods and lightly massage or practice stretching the jaw. Wear a mouth guard at night if you tend to clench your teeth. If you are still experiencing discomfort, please call us at 954-693-9090 or stop by our Davie facility for a consultation. Our professionals will arrange an individualized approach to correct your TMJ and help you manage the pain associated with it. For more info, please visit www.cardioflextherapy.com",

I have been dealing with it since 2007. Originally I received three or four Cortizone shots to help me be able to move and walk.  After that, I went to physical therapy and developed a regimen of stretching that has helped. On a daily basis I would say that on a scale of 1 to 10, my pain level and discomfort level is pretty manageable and is probably at worst a a dull discomfort at around a 4 or 5.  I actually do not take anything for it and just ""suck it up"" and go about life.  It's been harder for me to develop muscle in my core because it's hard for me to get to the gym and stretch and do everything these days with the family and work but I still more or less get to stretch and keep the pain manageable. I try to avoid taking NSAIDs or any other type of pain medication. i've decided to not get any more Cortizone shots because I don't think they were really helping much. And I decided not to get a discectomy because I know people that had that done later had issues again. I'm curious how others are managing their discomfort and am looking for best practices.  For example if you do stretches or yoga, does it help? If so, how often do you do it? Do you get total pain relief? Perhaps I am not doing enough? Do you take supplements?  Have you gotten surgery? If so has it helped? Did you get a discectomy? Or did you get spinal fusion? What is your lifestyle like? For example, I desire to be moderately active. I am relatively young at 40 years of age.

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/26299/strange-panic-attacks,Strange panic attacks?,"Treated for unipolar depression/anxiety since 1999 with mainly Prozac and Benzo's PRN, until 2015 first pure hypomanic episode (in retrospect always BP, just mixed episodes), put on Lamictal and Prozac, eventually dropped Prozac. Lamictal wasn't really cutting it, but didn't want to go on lithium partly because of side effects and I kept wanting to self medicate with alcohol (surprise) and thought lithium might curtail that. Anyway, I waited to long, in July started having strong suicidal thoughts to the point I was making plans- and matter of factly started sharing these plans with my two kids which made perfect sense to me at the time, then I started ultra rapidly cycling, moods changing within hours, and the depression got super intense, I had to admit myself. So stayed 5 days inpatient, got off booze, on lithium 900mg ,neurontin, and stayed on lamictal 200. I felt ok, no longer suicidal or rapid cycling. But developed some very strange anxiety symptoms. I had difficulty going down (not up) stairs, had to hold on tight, and if I bumped my foot mini panic. Also would get squishy legs walking down the hall, felt like couldn't walk. I've gotten it before when I was having panic attack level anxiety. But this time I wasn't feeling super anxious, but some. So I tried .5 Xanax and cured it! But the strangest is I've been riding a bike for many years- I'm 54- and I was riding along first time back on a bike and blacked out a few seconds and legs started shaking uncontrollably and hit the ground. Well that ended that ride, started walking home, felt better, decided to ride slowly home on the sidewalk, but soon as I got on the bike shook like hell and fell. Next couple weekends tried riding again on sidewalk and found that anytime I got a little adrenalin going like a tight turn, it would trigger it, I could recognize it and put my legs down. The third week I tried it just tryning to get on the bike I shook. I decided I wouldn't ride, but would try to just sit on it. I did this in the garage and immediately blacked out a few secs, shook uncontrollably and fell, smashing my side into the side of the garage bruising a rib. That was a month ago- takes that long to heal. I've been worked up by a neurologist, not seizures, cardiologist next, but I'm pretty sure it's an anxiety manifestation. But why does it have to be a bike- one of my favorite things to do! Anyone can relate to similar symptoms?","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Bipolar Disorder"

I found this resource, I studied several articles about the pain that I had. I applied few tips from those articles and in a while I felt better. Here are some tips from this site: Exercise: Regular exercise not only helps to build strength and endurance, it also helps keep your weight under control which can help prevent back pain. Most experts agree that low-impact aerobic exercises are the best because these activities avoid straining or jerking the back. Exercises that help strengthen the back and abdominal muscles, core-strengthening exercises, will help protect your back. Flexibility exercises, targeting the flexibility in your upper legs and hips may be beneficial also to reduce the potential for back pain. Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional before beginning any exercise program. Stop Smoking: Back pain occurs at a significantly higher rate among smokers compared to non-smokers of the same weight, height, and age. Maintain a healthy weight: Being overweight also increases your risk of developing back pain. The more overweight you are, the greater your risk of having pain in your back. Maintain good posture when standing: Keep your pelvis position neutral. To do this, keep your back straight with your head facing forward. Balance your weight equally on both feet, with your legs straight. Maintain good posture when sitting: To reduce your risk of back pain, your seat or chair should have adequate support for your low back, armrests and ideally, it should be able to swivel if you are working. When you are sitting, keep your knees and hips level and your feet flat on the floor. If your feet don't rest on the floor, use a small footrest or footstool to prevent back pain. Ideally, you should be able to sit straight up with good support in the ""small"" of your back. (the lumbar spine area). When you use a keyboard, your forearms should be horizontal with your elbows at right angles. Lift properly: The key to preventing back pain when lifting is to lift with your legs, not your back. Keep your back straight, with your feet shoulder-width apart. Place one foot slightly in front of the other to keep your balance and bend from your knees, not from your waist. Hold the object close to your body, maintain your back as straight as possible and tighten your abdominal muscles. This will pull your pelvis in. Remember to not straighten your legs before you lift. If you do, your back will be forced to do most of the lifting. Never lift and turn or twist at the same time. If the load is too heavy, prevent back pain by getting help. While lifting, keep your eyes focused straight ahead. Don't look up or down. This will keep your neck in a straight line with your spine and prevent back strain and back pain. Move objects correctly: It's is easier on your back to push objects than to pull them across the floor. Wear the proper shoes: High heels put the strain on your back. Shoes with no heel are better for preventing back pain. Drive and ride correctly: To prevent back pain when travelling, make sure to have proper support for your back. Make sure the rear-view mirrors are positioned correctly so you can avoid twisting. The pedals should be squarely under your feet. If you are travelling long distances, take frequent breaks to get out of the vehicle and walk around to avoid back fatigue and back pain. Rest right: The how to prevent back pain formula may be connected to how and where you sleep. The mattress on your bed should be able to support the weight of your buttocks and shoulders while keeping your spine straight. Keep a pillow under your head, but it should not force your neck into a sharp angle, which can cause upper back pain. Read more in this article:","Neck Pain , Back Pain"

My mother is a horrible person so I lived with my father for most of my teenage years. My father abandoned me when I was 17. He had a drug problem & I woke up to an empty apt.   Fast forward, I've been married for 6 years (been with my now husband for 8 years), have a 5 yr old son, & have always been completely honest with my spouse about my mental issues. I'be also been employed with the same company for 16 years & am now a high ranking staff member at a very large financial institution. There are only 3 colleagues that have ever been made aware of my illness. I started a daily antidepressant about 2.5 years ago & have anxiety meds to "" put the fire out"" on the truly unbearable days. I was feeling really positive about life and was starting to believe that maybe my illness was not going to win.  Lately, I'm desperately sad, I don't like the way I look, I've had a short fuse with my son ( which is breaking my heart ), & I feel so unvalued at work. I'm afraid to talk to anyone face to face bc other than my husband, I never have. I don't want my son to worry about me. I don't know what to do & I thought that by maybe at least writing my thoughts out would be a bit therapeutic.",

Smoke about 15 a day and social drinker but beer enthusiast so will have 1 IPA or similar with dinner a night. I have had slight anxiety since my mid 20's when I strained chest muscles playing golf which led to chest pain and a panic attack.  It's all gone down hill starting a year ago today. I was camping and just woke up and had some breakfast and a 1/2 cup coffee when everything started going sideways. And I mean that literally. I felt like my head was flip flopping and got very disoriented,light headed, and shaky. A (very long) trip to the ER later they wrote it off as slight dehydration and sent me on way. All labs were normal. Fast forward to October and was walking back in from lunch at work when I started getting the same wobble, strange feelings in my head, and started shaking horribly. EMT's were called and my BP was 170/116 and pulse 85 (pulse was still ok). Went to ER once again, they ran EKG and CAT scan which all came back normal. All labs once again also normal. I followed up with my primary and they decided I should see a neuro and cardio to rule anything out. Cardio was a easy EKG and stress test, passed with flying colors. Neuro requested MRI and MRA contrast and non. Both came back normal. Next he sent me for additional bloodwork.... OK BOOM - B12 was in low normal range but from what I have read this can cause some neuro symptoms, imbalace, as well as mock other conditions. I've been on sublingual 1200 mcg drops, B6, and folic acid for 2 months.. This is where everything else comes in - I STILL FEEL AWFUL. I have daily episodes where I feel like world is crashing in, head feels weird ALL THE TIME, my muscles feel like they are constantly overused and like NERF if that makes any sense. All in all there is not one day that goes by I don't think I'm going to end up back in the hospital.  As I said, I'm pretty laid back. I don't get stressed out at my job much even though I'm a higher level manager and alot of responsibility. I have a good family life, eat well, prob dont exercise enough, but all in all should be not feeling this way. Can this be anxiety?",Anxiety & Panic Disorders

Ive became sick in April 2016 and have not been the same since. I had mri, ct, blood work, stool samples, eyes checked , seen ent and everything came back good but Im far from good Sorry for the long msg but this is affecting my life so much and here is a long history of how it all started April 2016 I woke up one morning up to my work hotel (I work in another province) and it felt like I was drunk! Everything i tired to look at I couldn't. It was all a big blur. I didn't go to doctor until my left arm started to go numb and II couldn't focus on anything. Also my head was very lightheaded. (not sure if a coincidence or not but two nights before at work I got very cold, so cold in fact I couldn't talk proper afterwards for a little while. The cold came from my lower back and my left side of face was causing the problem for trying to talk. Anyways I went to doctor and just said I was dissy and he said I had vertigo and gave me serc and it went away. Before it went away I had very bad motion sickness which I never had A week later I returned home the symptoms came back (not s bad as initial drunk feeling) after I tried to clean my ears (or that's my guess). My left arm went a little numb again. I got sec again from another doctor. My focus problems improved but I could telll something is off and not rite. FYI I continued to take sec until June 2017!! Had bloodworm done, ct scan, stool sample and everything came back good but I still felt lightheadness, and was off and hard time to focus. Doctors just though crystals in my ears were off Went to ent in August 2016. He finally explained that I didn't have vertigo as I'm lightheadness and I didn't have vertigo which is the room is spinning around me and all ear tests came back good. He couldn't understand why sec would work as to him it should be useless. He proceeded to clean my ears and removed a large chunk of wax from left ear. two days later my left side of my face and my neck went numb. Felt very weak. I went to doctor who then thought I had nerve damage from the cold and requested I see neurologist.. I couldn't and still can't put anything in my ears such as listening to music as it makes me sick the next day Tried to give up my sec pills but when I did my left eye would vibrate and i couldn't focus so I got back on them Seen neurologist. in november 2016. He said to him everything seemed fine even though I told him I feel way of. He requested a mri I continued to feel off and lightheadness and hard to focus and if i forgot a serc pill I would feel worst November 2016, shoppers drug mart gave me the generic of serc which made me very sick and didn't work for me also Had Mri Feb 2017 on my head. Everything came back good. Then in early March I felt perfect, best i did in years then all of a sudden mid march it was like April 2017 all over again but kinda different. My left eye wouldn't stop vibrating, I couldn't focus, felt like gonna throw up, and was gonna pass out at random times. This went away (back to my new normal which still wasn't perfect). I was at work april 2017 and got very sick again. Hard to focus, but this time felt very warm and flustered like I had a fever or blood pressure was up. My legs would burn. I checked blood pressure and it was good. I would feel the worst in the mornings and feel overheated after lunch. I had severe motion sickness. I had to be driving. and if I had to stop and go a lot in traffic it would make me feel sicker. This went away after 2 weeks and back to my new normal.  I gave up sec pills June 15th to see how I would be when seeing the ent. I was a little bit worst but not totally I went back to ent last week and he said again it's not a ear problem and has referred me back to a neurologist. He cleaned my ears and now I feel very off again I do have anxiety over this all as I have a fear of getting sick and not working as I have a lot of bills. He said this could make symptoms worst. Im very tired all the time. My left arm feels weaker than right arm. If I make sharp left turns it feels worst than right turns. Hard for me to focus as I like to drift off when somebody is talking to me. This is affecting my work as I usually work at heights but have not since and my work choices are limited Anxiety does run in my family but I only have it since I got sick. Could you wake up feeling like your drunk and serc help and it be anxiety? the part with things in my ears making me sick throws off the anxiety part. Im just not sure what tests are going to be next. I am overweigh a bit (511 and 220 as I stop exercising) and have diarrhea daily since a year Sorry for the long rite up but this has been a very hard year and I have a 2 year old son and have been sick for half of his life so far any suggestions greatly apppreciated",#Agate
Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/48825/doctor-says-ingrown-toenail-will-heal-itself,Doctor says ingrown toenail will heal itself,"I have had an ingrown toenail for about 4 weeks now, and about a week ago it became infected. There is also a lump of skin growing on the side of the nail which I believe is granulation tissue. It's really sore and I can't wear shoes. After a week of soaking it, taking painkillers and applying antiseptic/numbing cream, it still hadn't been getting better. This afternoon I went to the doctors. She says there is nothing she can do, and she recommends just wearing sandals rather than proper shoes, because it only hurts when I wear shoes (that is mostly true - sometimes it throbs but most of the time doesn't hurt if I'm not wearing socks or shoes). I asked if she could give me antibiotics - she says it won't help. I asked if she could do surgery to remove a part of the nail - she said the procedure would mean I won't be able to walk for a few weeks after, and it is hassle booking an appointment.  She recommended letting the toenail grow out, and says the lump of skin is nothing to worry about and it will be healed in a few weeks. This goes against all advice I've read online. Can infected toenails heal themselves? Shall I follow her advice and wear open toe shoes for a few weeks? Or should I wait a few days and go to a different doctor?  (In the photo - the red isn't blood, that's remnants of red nail polish, and the yellow colour is from a cream/gel that the doctor applied. She gave me a prescription for the cream/gel, and says to use that and wrap my toe up if I have to wear shoes)",

My back at 35 was starting to really bother me so I saw a Neurologist and was informed I had Spinal Bifida ( Occulta) but not the nice one. He submitted for me to have surgery but they wanted to wait. At this time I had a bone growing on to my tailbone and it was trying to act like the joint that was above it when you bend over.   Now I am 55 and around 44 I still was having so many problems with back and knee's. MRI showed from waist down I had bulging disk an extra vertebrae which was actually the bone that had grown on also herniated disk. Then my knees were also shot. I was bone in bone on both knees. In 2009 I had a car accident which put small fractures up and down my spine. I also had a knee replacement in 2014 which almost cost me my life.  I am skeptical of having another knee replacement on right knee because last operating I lost over 4 pints of blood. In 2014 we all know they changed the law on scheduling of certain medications. (They should have left Norco alone, You cannot shoot it nor snort it) I see where they say our nation has an opioid problem but honestly that was more when they came out with time released oxycodone (Oxycotin) and more .

Mental Health Create a Post  Telligent.Evolution.Extensibility.Api.Entities.Version1.ForumThread. Anonymous 11 hours ago I can't stop thinking or questioning things to the point where it is affecting my performance in school. I have really long trains of thought. I cannot stop thinking and when I go to school I cannot concentrate no matter how hard I try because there is a loud voice in my head just thinking and thinking all day long. I have actually failed two quizzes now because it is so hard for me to listen in the classroom...I woke up one morning and asked my self a simple question, and I came up with two possible answers and from those two answers I came up with more questions, and more possible answers and it just continues throughout the day until I go to sleep. Then I wake up the next day and remind myself where I left off in my thought process, and I continue my train of thought. It is starting to scare me because it distracts me from school and a few of my grades have dropped because I cannot stop thinking about these crazy topics. I am an 18 year old high school student and I suffer from anxiety. I do not smoke cigarettes, I rarely drink alcohol, but I moderately smoke marijuana because it helps me a lot with my anxiety. I tried researching what this could be and I found a lot of anxiety related answers, but those answers described overthinking things and worrying about things, but my thinking processes are not worrisome. My boyfriend asked to see what one of my thought processes was like, so here is an example of a message that I sent him, which is what I was thinking at that moment he asked me: ""You know how we are a physical embodiment of our souls? And people usually consider their physical appearances a big part of their personality? Like the things we wear, piercings, tattoos, and what we do with our hair. That's only a small aspect of our personality, so who are we with out our physical appearances? What does our inner being consist of? Do my opinions make me who I am? In the controversy of abortion, I am pro choice. So is being pro choice a part of who I am? I don't think so because that is an opinion that I have about something in the physical world. If that controversy never existed, who would I be then? Do my values make me who I am? I value my friends and my well being. Does that make me who I am? I don't think so because those are basic human values. I think our inner being consists of something that makes us unique from every other inner human being. If we eliminate all physical properties and all that is left is our souls, then who is my soul and how is it different from everyone else's soul? What if I have it all wrong? What if all of our souls are exactly the same and it is up to the individual to create his/her own unique being? If this was true, then should we be okay with the bad people in this world? For example murderers, they want to be murderers so why would we stop someone from being who they want to be? (I know this sounds horrible, but complete open mindedness is necessary for this topic. I do not agree with murder, this is just for the sake of this example.) But murderers are a product of our society. People are oppressed, abused, or traumatized and become murderers. So in this government, we create murderers and then throw them in jail as punishment for doing something that they found pleasure in. People think that there is only one criminal and one victim, but actually, the murderer is also a victim. A victim of this government. This government is the real criminal (for turning its own citizens to into horrible people), and the prisoners are the victims (because they are bad due to a crappy government) Many prisoners are actually very smart people, and sometimes that is why they are in prison! They are a threat to the government so they find a stupid reason to put the smart people in jail. Smart people end up dying in cells every day. Smart people actually live miserable lives because they know too much about the real world. Smart people are smart enough to realize that being smart isnt all that fun, because you know things that you dont want to know.."" This train of thought continued for about 6 hours and by the end of the night i found myself talking about the multiverse theory. Let me remind you that this started off with the absurdity of astrology and led to the multiverse theory. It happens consistently and even when I am talking to someone, I cannot concentrate on what they say because my mind is too distracted with this thinking. It has come to the point where I get horrible headaches every night and the thinking still doesn't stop and it is starting to worry me. My boyfriend said that I showed incredible analysis and critical thinking but I am actually scared of this and I want it to calm down. Has this happened to anyone else?

I was out the whole season and was never given an exact answer on what was wrong. The pain was in the rotator cuff area and the top of the shoulder by the deltoid. After months it finally calmed down and I ha domt range of motion and strength back. I thought I was fine but it turns out it wasn't gone. Whenever I get hit in the shoulder, fall and use my arm to brace the fall, throw my arm up in the air really fast, or get hit in the arm by a ball if it's fully extended my shoulder feels like it goes dead and I cannot bear the pain. It just hangs and instantly takes all of the energy out of me. My mood changes and I can barely move it. It goes away after a two or three days and I regain my strength and movement until soemthing happens to it again, then the process repeats itself. This has been going on for three years, I went to two orthopedic doctors and a chiropractor and none of them did any good. I've done physical therapy and it did not works. I've gotten x rays and nothing showed up I haven't gotten an MRI on it yet because none of the doctors suggested one. If I push in on my left shoulder it makes a squishing noise and I can make it pop by lifting my elbow up and out to the side. It feels a lot softer than my other shoulder and it pops.

I’m a 31 year old male. The pain is a stabbing/tender pain under my left pectoral muscle bordering on my armpit, and is there most of the time at varying degrees. At times it’s also accompanied by nausea (felt in my throat), occasional headaches, neck, shoulder and middle back pain. I also have ankle pain most of the time in both ankles and a bad right wrist (wrist is most likely from a bicycle crash 2 years ago).  In the last year, I’ve been to the ER twice, and both times the EKG and blood work came back fine. The second time, they did a CT scan of my upper left chest and found nothing wrong.   I’ve also visited with my PCP, who did a comprehensive metabolic panel and a couple other blood tests, all of which came back fine. She also ordered chest Xrays, which came back negative for anything wrong with the lungs or chest area.  She referred me to a cardiologist, who ordered a lipid panel for cholesterol. Cholesterol levels came back fine, with all levels bordering on ideal or not worrisome. I also did a stress echo at the cardiologist, and he said that nothing is wrong with my heart.  I went to a gastroenterologist, and he recommended an upper endoscopy, which I just had today. He stated after that my throat, stomach, and intestines looked completely normal and that he took biopsies which I will have the result for in 1-2 weeks. He prescribed me a proton pump inhibitor, because in the last few months I’ve seen my conditions improve on/off with these (not sure if they’ve actually helped or not).  At this point, I’m just not sure where to turn. Seems I have a lot of the symptoms of Fibromyalgia (I also urinate frequently and have anxiety/depression over the situation), but I’m not convinced the chest pain is from that because for one I’m male (mostly females get Fibro), and secondly from what I’ve seen chest/armpit pain doesn’t normally line up with the normal Fibro pain spots.  If anyone has any ideas what may be going on here, I’d love to hear them. I’m going to follow up with my PCP once I get my biopsy results, but want to make sure it’s a productive conversation to move things forward. Thanks so much for reading, and good luck to everyone!

After 2 miles into the walk my 4 pack feels churned or redmeat hammered and halfway the spine feels achy or halved. When I get home I'm able to contour back in bed or stretch myself so the spine isn't hinged halfway or less achy. Is there anyway to receive medical attention at this point and what is best or healthcare system?

I am 19 years old and have been experiencing pain in my joints for over 2 years now. It has mainly been in my left hip but has also been in my right hip, both shoulders, both knees, and occasionally my elbows. For a while the pain would come and go but now it seems to be more constant and painful.  These areas of my body also tend to make clicking noises, feel like they lock, have sharp pains, or get stiff and then pop when I bend them. Along with that, when I walk my left hip sometimes feels like it is popping out. It seems like no matter how much I move or how much I rest or take it easy they continue to hurt.

He then spent the past year at a community college taking a light course load of general ed. classes --of which he failed also. By failing I mean he actually got Fs in all his classes for both semesters. He says he went to the classes but is fuzzy and vague as to any other details. It's pretty hard to get Fs in community college unless you simply just dont show up--which I feel is what probably happened. He does not have ADHD, and he is very bright. The issues I'm most concerned about are that he is a chronic liar, even about the smallest of things, does not understand cause and effect very well, nor as he has stated feels much guilt when issues arise, has very poor social boundaries and is unable to apply himself in school, has poor hygiene. He has gone to a few therapists --one that he's been to a few times now--who he says is ok but again is very vague about whether the therapy is helpful and insists that he's only doing it because I'm insisting he go.  He takes antidepressants which he says mostly help and is having meds. monitored by a psych. Josh states he wants to get his life together and find out why he's unable to apply himself like other kids his age which is very positive-- but then doesn't follow through with an assessment apt. with his psych. Josh exhibits alot of similarities to his father (my ex)--who has never been dx with a condition-- who lied frequently, had stunted emotional development and who my son despises. While Josh may have inherited some of his father's negative traits, his father is also very hard working/self motivated and has a strong work ethic. Josh also had a much more nurturing and stable childhood--although there was a fair degree of trauma he experienced during our divorce--so it's confusing that if he does have whatever his father has--what is it and why are the symptoms expressed so strongly. Any feedback of family or friends with similar symptoms would be much appreciated. I feel I'm completely in the dark and have to rely on reaching out on forums (which I do appreciate very much) to get help for him. Since he's an adult I have to rely on his own vague sometimes shady feedback about the effectiveness of apts. attended and meanwhile still not getting to the bottom of what is going on with him.

Until recently I didn't have a problem getting them. Then the law changed and my PM doctor retired. She recommended a Dr and that's where the problems started. The doctor said he was cutting my meds and I had to get epidurals in place of some of the meds. I said I had no problem as long as my PAIN stayed under control. Long story short, my pain was not under control and my BLOOD PRESSURE skyrocketed to Around 211/103. I ended up in the emergency room. I received a morphine shot and boost control medicine for my blood pressure. I could have had a stroke or something even worse than that. The social worker at the hospital called around and got me an appointment for 6 days later with a new PM Dr. The doctor was very understanding and I couldn't be happier. I am on a lower dose of PAIN meds, but they are being lowered at a slower pace.(not cut in half in just a few visits) As for the epidurals, I'm not sure that they are good for me. My blood pressure remains high, 168/86. I will discuss this with my new PM Dr, because I need to get my bp lowered immediately. My advice to you would be to research the doctors by reading blogs, by researching their background, or to call the social worker at the hospital to recommend some doctors. It might take some time to find the right doctor, but with time and patience I am sure you will.GOOD LUCK!","Chronic Pain , Headaches , Neck Pain , Medication , Back Pain"

We met for coffee that week and for the rest of 2016 became considerably close platonic friends.  Earlier this year I started noticing more angry outbursts from her. In April she invited me to her house for dinner. There she told me that she was not doing well and was on high medication. She also thought her brother might want to shoot her and looked thin. Like every time I had with her I enjoyed her company that night and was appreciated how she had invited me into her home. Without warning the next day she unfriended me from a major social media platform. Then came the unreturned texts just like two years ago, even on her birthday. Now she appears to have blocked me altogether from the same social media platform. I worry and think about her everyday and wonder if she will come back again.

Recently, and experienced strange headaches. I'll tell you in order. Once I was sitting at the computer and felt a muscle tension in the neck and shoulders. There was discomfort, the head was ""heavy"" to hold. Did not attach much importance. Then headaches began. They are rather strange. There are only (!) With excitement and anxiety, how calm emotionally, instantly pass. Accompanied by fear (stroke, etc.), and the stronger the fear, the greater the pain. Begin with a spasm in the neck. She whines and muscles are tense. Then I start to wind myself, and there is an alarm. The power of pain is completely proportionate to the strength of anxiety. The pains are compressive and bursting, the pain is dull and aching, the ears are burning. At the peak of my anxiety, there is a strong pulsation of blood vessels in my head (pain is not pulsating, just pulsation). It seems that the blood vessels now burst, there is a fear of death. It becomes hot in the face, the face ""blows out"" with a hot wind, the whole head is compressed and strongly aching, especially the ears. As soon as I relax, smile, reduce anxiety with the help of auto-training - the pain ceases and immediately passes. When completely relaxed, the muscles of the neck stop being clamped and a wave of pleasant trembling, a shiver rolls over the back. At the peak of fear during pain, the face is poured cold with sweat, hot flashes and then hot flashes. Hands are also icy and wet. Sometimes such pains are accompanied by discomfort and mild pain in the back, as well as painful tension of the muscles of the hands and feet, their stiffness. There was some anxious waiting for the next attack of such pain. I measured the pressure at the peak of the headache (I was all scared then, I was afraid of a stroke or something), it was 175 by 90. Calmed down, measured a second time after a small interval - 140 to 90. Once there was another unpleasant condition, I think associated with this pain. Has arisen once and has not been repeated. I woke up in the morning with stuffed ears, as if stunned. The condition was similar to the presence of a sulfur plug. Audibility was good, the only thing, the surrounding sounds a little resonated in my head with a light echo, my ears were a little wadded. After hours 4 this stuffiness has passed.

At age 11 we saw a naturopath and discovered she was highly copper toxic. We spent the next few years gently detoxing and while off and on we would see slight improvements, she never fully recovered.  During that time she saw a counselor for a few months who gave her some helpful tips, but in general there are no causative environmental factors for her depression and so the counselor and my daughter both agreed she had helped as much as she could.  A couple years later my daughter agreed to see another counselor. But after just a few visits she was frustrated. Her depression isn't caused by bad circumstances or poor perceptions of reality so she didn't feel it was helping.  A year ago we all gave in and she saw a psychiatrist who officially diagnosed her with major depressive disorder and social anxiety. He was recommended by the counselor. He eventually put her on the highest doses of lexapro and wellbutrin that he prescribed for her a B12/folate compound. I get the impression there is nothing more he can do for her. The medicines caused her moods to quit fluctuating so wildly, but they just stabilized at very low with some lower swings. The B12/folate gave her a week or two of energy and happiness but it faded.  6 months ago we started seeing a different naturopath. The copper is still high but a normal high. Her adrenals and other hormones are off. He did not mention hypothyroid. He did labs and hair analysis. Her readings indicated heavy metal issues. So, he has been detoxing metals, supporting the liver, giving brain support and flax and oils and other things. He seems confident and competent. But, she is not better.  I am at a loss. Everything I google about teen depression tends to be about typical teen depression (emotional/social etc.). That is not her issue.

I don't even know where to start or how to handle the situation. I started getting migraines at 27 (I'm 45 now). I've tried more preventative/abortive medications than I can name, had at least 20 MRI and CT scans, and I have been seen by 4 neurologists. The last one told me that I had ""terminal migraines"", and the only treatment he would consider was Botox. If I hadn't had Bell's Palsy in the right side of my face in 2008, I might have considered it. I was lucky with Bell's and didn't have any obvious residual paralysis after it subsided. I was prescribed Fioricet by my PCM, and had good success with it, but my PCM finally got to the point where he started refusing to fill it. I have always been dead-set against going to pain management because of the stigma. It was my last resort. I finally broke down a couple of years ago and asked for the referral. I've been at the same clinic the entire time, on the same medication, and same dose. I take both an immediate release and extended release of Nucynta. My records at this clinic are spotless...I have never violated protocol in any way. The problem started when the manufacturing plant for the ER Nucynta was destroyed in the hurricane that hit Puerto Rico. Another company bought the right to manufacture the ER, but it's taken 3 months for the pharmacy to get them back in stock because the manufacturer is only allowed to produced a specific amount of pills at a time. Starting in mid-Jan, my pain provider switched me to immediate release and an ER version of hydrocodone. It didn't work well for me, so I asked her last month to drop the hydrocodone and go back to the immediate release Nucynta until the pharmacy could restock the ER. At my appointment this morning, I was told that my drug screen from the month I was on hydrocodone (Feb) tested positive for oxycodone. I realize most people, my provider included won't believe me, but I did not take any oxycodone. I didn't take any drug from another person, OTC or otherwise. She told me it was supposed to be a written infraction, but only put down a verbal. If I had violated protocol, I wouldn't complain, but I. Did. Not. Do. This. I don't know what to do or if there is anything I can do to get this removed from my records. I think that the circumstances speak for themselves...it's an awfully big coincidence that my urine tested positive for oxycodone the same month that I was switched to hydrocodone.

There's always a problem or issue at work that causes her to just hate it so much she has to leave. But i don't think she understands that that is not her anxiety or depression. Its just part of life, there will always be something or someone that you don't like. There will always be a *** sandwich to eat in life, you just need to work out what *** sandwich your going to stick with. Can i ask please. Why is it that people that aren't 'Diagnosed' with anxiety and depression have to keep there lip zipped, like it or lump it and man up and get on with things. But people with anxiety and depression have to be tiptoed around all the time. Its like i have to tread on eggshells with everything otherwise i might set something off. Why in the past 25 years, has anxiety and depression increased in late teens to early adults by 75%?! What is going on? I feel like its to do with people just not being able to control their normal, everyday feelings. But i know its more than that as it is due to chemical imbalances. Can i also just say that she smokes tobacco heavily, smokes cannabis on a daily basis, doesn't do any exercise and doesn't eat very healthily. So just before i may get any 'Your ignorant' replies, she not actually helping herself at all in my eyes, shes doing nothing to counterbalance these unbalanced chemicals..

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/46825/knee-injury-with-no-hospital,Knee Injury With No Hospital,"So long story short, amost two months ago, I hurt my knee. I was in a wrestling match (Girl wrestler) and I twisted my knee. It didn't really hurt at first. I could still walk but from here and there, I can feel a sharp pain, so I went tp the medicial attention center. All the medical attention center at the competition is put some ice on what's hurting. I went home and told my peoples what happened but of course, I knew what answer I was going to get. My mom doesn't have enough money to send me to the hospital for treatment. Now, after two months of walking on my bad knee ALOT, I can't do simple home workouts with feeling a pain and I can crack my knee whenever I please. When I crack it, I hold my foot with my other foot and rotate towards the left. Doing this helps random tightness I feel from here and there. The crack is louder than a pen dropping in a quiet room.  But anyways, I was wondering what should I do? Since I obviously don't have money for medical attention (also, no insurance), should I invest in a knee brace? and if so, what kind? Tell me everything. I really need to help my knee before it goes too bad. A teen with a knee of a 50 year old will only hinder my future. Thank you in advanced :)",Knee Pain

I respect my doctors and other medical professionals immensely, but I am genuinely desperate. In October (about 5 months ago) I visited my PCP after feeling sickly for weeks on end. I had been having low-grade fevers on a daily basis, joint pain and general aches, and fatigue so bad I would sleep for 16 hours. My blood work came back with normal CBC, but positive for mono. I was given prednisone (which did nothing) and told I would feel better in a week or two. 5 months later, my symptoms have only gotten worse. With my fevers come a bright red butterfly shaped rash across my face, and I am often too sick to get out of bed. I visited the doctor once again, who agreed that the fevers were not likely caused by the mono I had five months ago. She thought there was a chance of an autoimmune condition, so tested my ANA, CRP, CBC, ESR, and for lyme (for good measure). Yet, every single test came back within the normal range. I had been treated for kidney pain recently as well, but all that showed up in my urine was a little protein and white blood cells (but not an amount too excessive). With having tested negative for lupus, lyme, and any sort of infection, I do not know what to think. My fevers have not subsided, and the rash on my face shows up a few times a week at least (it's not itchy, just hot). I also continuously break out in hives, despite having had allergy testing (not sure if this is related). If I don't have an autoimmune condition, lyme, mono, or any infection, why on earth am I feeling so sick and what can I do to feel better? I feel like I have tried everything, and I eat and exercise well. Even pain meds do a poor job of relieving my symptoms.

I'm a 28 year old female and about 17 months ago I suffered a horrible nervous breakdown from medication withdrawal that my doctor took me off way too quickly. It was only one med that I truly should not have been on in the first place. I was living in Nashville at the time and stuck it out as long as I could as I had little support. Mostly only from a few friends who did the best they could. 9 months after my withdrawal I somehow made it back to my small hometown in Northern California. I could only push through about 7 months of being home as I could not handle the suppression and bad memories of small town that still haunts me even with endless therapy. I am not running from my problems as I have made peace with those demons long ago. I just don't want to be reminded of things that have happened to me.  Fast forward to now. I moved back to Nashville and in with friends. They do the best they can but even they don't seem as supportive as I would have hoped. No one believes me that I am steal healing from this horrible drug I was on for 8 years. Moving back has sent me in a tailspin. Not only do I feel a strange lack of support but I live in a neighborhood that makes me feel so incredibly unsafe. It is one of the worst areas to live in. I know my way around and yet I began having terrible panic attacks all over again on the highways, in the grocery stores and restaurants.  I am unable to work as my panic is terrible anytime I leave the house so I am running out of money and I have no insurance. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I cannot go back home as I feel so isolated there but its even worse here.

I don't know if I should stay put and work through it as best I can or if I should try moving again. Moving is stressful enough but it's 10x worse when you're brain is misfiring every day.

I am currently working on trauma issues with a therapist. I was sexually abused as a child/adolescent by the person who was my pediatrician as well as other individuals.  *Warning: semi graphic information ahead* My sophomore year in high school, I had symptoms which when you look at the whole constellation of them could lead you to believe I was pregnant. Because of who one of my abusers was it was not uncommon for things to happen to me that very well could have resulted in a termination of a pregnancy without my being involved or knowing.  Only one memory exists which might have some bearing on that. I would have been only 15 and immature for my age so understand that I am only able to describe this through a child's perception. I was held down or restrained in some way. It was in his ""office"" which was in a private house and I never knew nurse's worked in places other than the school until I was way older than a normal kid because he didn't have one. My legs were being held spread wide open and I remember my hips hurt. He had a whole bunch of what I remember as metal sticks of all different sizes on a towel. He kept sticking them in me and there was terrible pain and my stomach hurt. I vomited at one point because it hurt so much and I was crying so hard. I don't remember much after that because I think I either passed out or dissociated. This would have been 1987.  I do not know what this episode was. If it was just more of the sadistic abuse which had in the past involved foreign objects. It is the most painful physically episode I remember. It is one of the last times he touched me. I escaped to college in just 2 years, early. But, I do not want to allow a false memory to be given to me just because something seems like it might be. So, my question is . . . Can my obgyn somehow during my exam tell if I was pregnant in the past? If not, do you think if I were to describe all my symptoms from back then to her along with the episode I desciped here - could I trust her opinion on what happened? I need to resolve this and I can't take the suspicion of a therapist with no medical knowledge. To be able to let it go or to face it, I need to hear the opinion from someone with better background to make that call. Especially since I have some medical training myself. Btw: my obgyn is an amazing person. She knows I have a difficult history. She sees me regularly just to check in. She is a big support. So, I know I can trust whatever she says.",Abuse Victims

I've heard of the somewhat significant fluid retention/bloating/water weight gain that people go through as a side effect during oral corticosteroid cycles but I've heard no consensus on whether the same side effect is present for localized injections and, if so, for how long (seeing as this injection is supposed to last several weeks/months). If I end up needing to go with a cortisone injection into my knuckle in order to reap longer term relief of the chronic inflammation, am I signing up for significantly increased fluid retention (and subsequently water weight) for the next few months/duration of relief?

She ended up not knowing what else to do for me because all the treatments she was trying was not helping so sent me to a pain management dr. They told me I didn't have PHN but had TN and scheduled me to have injections in my forehead and cheek, also put me on meloxicam 15mg and oxycodone 5mg. This past week, they did some type of injection and said it would help. It didn't! I go back this Thursday again and she said they were going to put me on marinol (I had been vaping CBD oil but they told me I had to quit vaping it). I've tried everything, gabapentin, tons of migraine meds (not sure why the neurologist prescribed them but they made things worse). Anyways, I don't know where to turn anymore. I am 56 years old and have never experienced this much extreme, consistent pain, nothing seems to help. Thought maybe someone here that has gone through something similar could shed some light or help me. Thank you.",

About 4 months ago I started getting pain in my right hip randomly and noticed it when I was lying down on my side. Over the past few months it has grown to get worse and more regular. Now I'm constantly in pain no matter what position I'm in or what I'm doing. Another strange thing started a month ago where I will just lightly touch or stroke my ankle and I feel almost electric shocks in my middle toe. Some kind of weird nerve thing, and I find my whole right leg goes completely numb when I sit with my legs crossed or when I sit on the floor.

It got so bad at one point that I had to push myself up off of my knees to stand up. It's gotten better as of late but it seems to limit my flexibility at my waist, before this happened I could bend over with both my legs locked perfectly straight and put the palms of my hands flat on the floor. Now when I try this I can't get past my kneecaps. My right leg will lock perfectly straight but my left refuses to and bows out. Also I can't stand to sit down its extremely uncomfortable, I either want to lay down or be standing, if I do sit standing up becomes painful and I can feel popping sensations as my body rights itself upwards. I'll hopefully see a chiropractor here soon but receiving some early input on what this might be would be appreciated.","Hip Pain , Back Pain"

I have always known 2017 would be my last year on earth and things have happened to insure that this is it for me. I have no idea why i am writing this. I was a mistake that can not be fixed. I have lost everything. My family, my kids, my friends and I am sick of feeling so sad all the time. Nothing helps and nothing will ever change the person I have become.  My parents divorced when I was 8. My dad left our lives when I was 10 leaving me as the youngest of 4 kids. My oldest sister then my brother, then my other sister, then me. My mom worked 2 jobs to support us and was never home. My brother who is 5 years older then me was a monster. He would beat me up all the time. I dont mean like your bigger brother who was mean to his little brother. I mean he beat me and beat me and beat me some more. When he wasnt beating me he would fight with my older sister and they would fight and beat on each other. She once protected me by hitting him with a can of soup and he hit her with a skillet. She was the only thing that stopped the beatings I would take. Until she couldnt take it anymore and she left.  So from then on it was me and my other sister taking the beatings. Until one day he beat her with a ice scrapper and bruised her leg dark blue all up and down her thigh. He never touched her again....so that left me.  I took all of it from the time I was 11 until I was 15 and one day he made threats to my mom and she finally called police and because he had guns at the house they got him out of our home.  My mom never did anything to stop any of this. She was weak and helpless and never stopped any of it. My brother once took a 25lb frozen turkey and smashed me in the face when i was 14. I thought I would stand up to him. As I layed on the floor with blood pouring out of my chin my mom just yelled at him and did nothing. I am 44 now and keep a beard to cover the scare that was never treated or healed.  One time I let our neighbor in our garage to borrow one of my brother tools. He kept the garage all to himself and when he found out I lent the tool of his to our neighbor he tracked me down while I was with my friends. He drove up and got out of the car and punched me in the face without any warning and I went down. I rememeber my friends who were all 12 at the time saying Dan what the *** man. He threatened them and picked me up by my hair and threw me in the car and punched me as we went home. I got out of the car thinking it was over and he hit me from behind knocking me down and then dragged me by my hair (it was longer at that time) into the house. He proceeded to beat the *** out of me and I could not open my eyes for days.  When I would come home from school and walk home from the bus I would see my two older friends sitting across the street listening to my mom and brother yell and scream at each other. I would see them laughing like it was a moving they were enjoying. I would go sit and laugh with them like I was part of the group but I knew they were making fun of me and my home. It was so humiliating.  As life has gone on I developed an intimidating look and tried so hard to be scary so people wouldnt mess with me. I was so scared that someone would know i was a coward and this was the only way I could protect myself. I myself turned into a monster. I have never hit any of the woman I was with but I would yell and scream and argue and was always so angry all the time. I later found out that verbal abuse is just as bad if not worse then physical abuse. I became the monster I was terrified of.  I was with someone for 12 years and she dealt with me through all of the years. She was a liar and bi polar herself but we had 2 kids together and as much as I loved her and she claimed she would stay with me and be loyal and loving to me, a person can only take so much. So she found someone else and began to cheat on me. Once I found out I was devistated. I always knew anyone who says they love me will leave and she did as well.  Now I am alone, I can not see my kids, I lost the one person who said she would stay with me and I have no friends. I have a good job and a nice car, but my only goal was to not be like my dad and I wanted to keep my family together. That is all gone now and as I said in the beginning of this post, I always knew this would be my last year in this world.  Someday I always said....someday I will kill myself and be done with this hell. Someday is rapidly approaching and I have researched C02 poisoning. But it looks like my newer car wont put out enough C02 to kill me so thats not going to work. I do not have a gun so I will have to try to get one from the hood or something. I can not bring myself to hang myself so i either need to locate a *** load of sleeping pills or find a gun.  Sadly it looks like hanging myself is what I will have to do. I hate myself and I know I was a mistake. My parents made a new years mistake and i was born in Sept of 72. I do not speak to or have a relationship with anyone in my family. My older sister tries to help because she knows what it was like. But I find that if they know how I feel they will just try to talk me out of it or get me stuck on a 72 hour evaluation. Who wants to deal with that? not me. My life is over and I will be finding a way within the next few days to make it happen.  Maybe someone out there will see this and post...oh please dont give up....but that means nothing to someone who has been in so much pain for the past 34 years. I can not rememeber anyting before age 10. But thats when the beatings began and every moment prior to that is a lost memory.  I am so sad and unhappy all the time and I wish I could just have a heart attack and die naturally. But hell has not had enough of me yet and wants me to stay and be miserable.  I wont stay here anymore. I hope if you think about hitting your kids or if you know someone who is being beaten that you will help them. Because even when it stops the pain lasts a lifetime.",

It's getting to the point where I am scheduling as many things as I can on one day because I know I am going to feel like crap and I would rather feel like crap one day than all of them. This has led to me not doing activities I used to like because even doing things I like that involve me being social lead to me feeling the way I do, it's getting frustrating. My GP doesn't seem to take it seriously, giving me generic advice, so I have stopped bringing it up, without having something tangible I feel like it's talking to a brick wall. I guess I just need a way to explain it, even if all that achieves is I understand it myself. I have never been good at explaining/expressing myself, so this is the best I can do. There are other things, but I don't want to cloud things, I don't know if they are related or something completely different. Thanks for any help/info I an gain here.",

I have experienced mania and depression and psychosis and I don't dispute the diagnosis, even though I regularly play with my meds, sometimes trying to induce mania. I have further been diagnosed with schizophrenia. I do not believe I have schizophrenia. I think my exaggerations have led to that diagnosis.  And that's the thing. I have made stuff up. I have acted out. I have purposely heightened or dramatized symptoms. I have done this since childhood, with various physical ailments, which is another thing I do today. I will always lie and say my fever is higher than it is, for example. I have done this even when the result is painful testing or hardcore medication with terrible side effects. I was born with multiple health defects and have undergone lots of medical interventions, including several surgeries. My theory is something must have snapped in my mind and I adopted seeking out medical attention as a coping strategy.  Now I am confused. I can not tell how much is fiction and how much is real. I do not know the extent of my mental health conditions, and I just recently considered that I may have that syndrome....which is, obviously, in and of itself a mental illness.

My daughter is now 18. She started having horrible anxiety when she was 8 after a storm that scared her so bad she was diagnosed with PTSD. She wouldn't go to school, wouldn't look outside, became obsessed with weather reports and was altogether completely irrational. We took her to countless therapists, finally found a good combination of meds (lexapro and lamictal) and she's been much better for the past 7 years or so. She had terrible panic attacks daily then the meds helped to where she barely had any. My question is, she had panic attacks whenever we said ""no"" or basically said the opposite of what she wanted. At first we thought she was faking but realized that was definitely not the case. She had another panic attack the other day- first one in about 3 years. And it was again because we told her she wasn't allowed to do something. (Namely, fly home from our summer vacation early to spend time with her friends and boyfriend.) She is going to college and I know it's a confusing, difficult time and she hates missing out, as we are gone for number of weeks. But she has always loved this vacation. It's almost like she has a subliminal manipulation that tells her when she hears something she doesn't want to she goes into a full-blown panic attack, screaming, swearing at me, hitting me and not being able to breathe.

it seemed perfectly normal and in fact i thought that everyone ""knew"" and believed in it. in addition i believed that this was also true of everyone else in the world, and that that was why people start charities and do good things for strangers, because it was the moral option to pay the suffering debt that everyone has. and finally, i also believed that everyone else had this belief-- not just about me but about everyone else. i never brought it up with another person because i had an unspoken assumption that everyone else ""knew"" this too and was acting accordingly. i remember watching the movie ""the secret"" as a kid, learning about what they call the ""law of attraction"", and considering it further evidence that i was right and was always killing people with my generated thought power.  as you can probably imagine, i was extremely depressed as a result of this belief and viewed the world as a negative place. it affected how i interacted with others, and it made me irritable and constantly guilty because i felt like in order to pay what i called ""my suffering debt"", the only moral option was to spend literally every remaining instant of my waking moment of my entire life helping others-- i believed that since i was ""bad"" and had ""bad thoughts"" that i hurt more people than average. even when i wasnt actively thinking about this belief, i was never able to feel really proud of or happy about anything i ever did or accomplished my academics, art, or writing because i believed that all of my actions except volunteering at charities were ""sins"". now, i dont have too much materially in this life, but i do donate to charities and i help out as much as i can, just because it truly is good to help others. when i had this belief, though, i would actually purposefully avoid people in public seeking donations because they triggered panic attacks; i feared if i got too close to them, let them look me in the eyes, etc that theyd be able to tell i was a sinner. starting one year ago i began having brief (days, weeks, 1-2 months) periods of lucidity about this belief before i see it as true and stop challenging it again. even if i am shown evidence or proof that my belief is not true i simply assume that the evidence is false or misleading and continue. clearly i am in one now. to be honest, this whole time i have been writing this  i am still not sure that i'm not just right and that this is the truth. i feel like there is no way of ever being able to prove whether or not powers generated by our thoughts. i am also thinking about how, in terms of provability and following known natural laws, this is not much worse than the beliefs many religious people have, and that therefore it is maybe a reasonable belief to have after all. i really dont want it to be true and am afraid. so anyway, thats what my weird transient by convicted beliefs are. am not sure if i should call them as delusions, since i'm not schizophrenic, and because for most of them over time my belief in them wanes and my conviction weakens in one particular one, until usually i have some kind of aha-moment where i realize quite suddenly that the belief makes no sense, and i find myself, unawarely, repeating the pattern and developing another false/bizarre and obsessed over belief. assuming that my brain is working the same way it always has, i most likely believe several things right now that make no sense and are bizarre, but i have no way of identifying which ones. i am currently seeing a therapist for my OCD, or i will be again in a few months, he is taking a holiday. i have never brought up the belief about thought killing to him because i never realized it was unusual. i feel very strange and confused right now. although i have many low-insight obsessions, this one has shaped a large amount of my life and contributed to a large amount of what i had thought was my necessary and deserved suffering and unhappiness. i didnt used to think i had a right to live and now im startinn to think maybe i do, so thats good even if its a strange and unfamiliar feeling. but i am mostly afraid of this belief returning. and i also wish i could tell what other beliefs i have that make no sense because i cant tell which ones do and dont. does this sound like anything beyond low insight OCD to you? i am wondering if i should see a practitioner who has special experience with psychotic disorders to help me come up with strategies for dealing with this particular aspect of my condition, or if i should stay with my current practitioner instead. he is an incredible listener, but i have mostly ended up using him as a venting board for various negative emotions more than anything, because the lack of insight about which of my beliefs, thoughts, and behaviors are and arent obsessions is currently severely hampering my success with practicing ERP outside the field (i dont know which behaviors to abstain from and which are good ones to continue doing. literally any action causes me to have anxiety so i can't use that to tell either). also, obviously this is a very rare moment of lucidity for me or i wouldnt be having this problem. im making sure to write this all down now because i know that in a few weeks ill be back to how i usually am. i dont know if itll help or if when i remember this post ill just think i was being ""super paranoid"", which has happened most of the times before","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Schizophrenia , Self Harm"

Since I can remember, I could not sit down on the floor, even for a minute, without my legs going numb or falling asleep, particularly the feet and lower leg region. I never really had that looked into, but am wondering if it is connected to other issues I have noticed as of late. I am now a 42 year old woman, with overweight issues. Even 10 years ago, whenever I would do cardio types of exercise (running, aerobics, walking), I would get really sharp shin splint pains on both legs.  Over the past year, I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and am very motivated to lose weight and get into shape. Those shin splint pains continued to persist, getting worse and worse every time. I finally decided to go to a store specializing in sports equipment, told the person working there what my issues were and she recommended a specific shoe. It cost me over $200, but was definitely worth it as it alleviated the shin splint pains. However, now I am noticing a pain in my left ankle when doing cardio. It seems to be in-between where my leg bone meets the foot, and sometimes it feels as though the leg bone is rubbing against the foot bone, causing sharp pains. I do have a doctor's appointment next week and plan on discussing these issues with my doctor. I am wondering if this is potentially arthritis pain, as I also sometimes feel pain in other joints when sleeping (like fingers, wrists, knees, and even hips), or if all of these issues I have had before are somehow related and can be a certain condition I might not be aware of. Any advice on potential diagnoses would be greatly appreciated, as I would definitely like to have a wealth of information to discuss over with my doctor next week.

I really want to get a second opinion to where I'd even pay for it. Anything but to have to live in this pain for life or be not taken seriously. I want to see if maybe they can take the mri where my legs are elevated since i feel the pain mostly when I'm standing up or sitting down(after time of being on my feet)  My question is: Has anyone had a different MRI show positive results? Or even had an MRI standing or where their legs weren't elevated show postive results? Thanks sorry its incredibly long I'm just feeling a little depressed about the whole thing.",

(This is almost definitely unrelated, but I noticed the bump about 5 minutes after I tucked my shirt in... At first I just thought the buttons scratched me or something) Over the next few days, it grew until it became a lump the size of my thumb, sticking out about a half-inch from my stomach. It became very hard and hurt a lot. Just today, I accidentally broke the surface of the bump and some blood came out. I squeezed the area around the break and a mixture of blood and white fluid came out. I kept squeezing and more came out. Now, I have stopped (I don't know if more will come out if I continue squeezing) but the wound continues to drain clear fluid. Unfortunately, the size of the lump has not decreased significantly, and the whole area (about the size of two quarters) is extremely red. What should I do?? Please help!

I cannot stop thinking and when I go to school I cannot concentrate no matter how hard I try because there is a loud voice in my head just thinking and thinking all day long. I have actually failed two quizzes now because it is so hard for me to listen in the classroom...I woke up one morning and asked my self a simple question, and I came up with two possible answers and from those two answers I came up with more questions, and more possible answers and it just continues throughout the day until I go to sleep. Then I wake up the next day and remind myself where I left off in my thought process, and I continue my train of thought. It is starting to scare me because it distracts me from school and a few of my grades have dropped because I cannot stop thinking about these crazy topics. I am an 18 year old high school student and I suffer from anxiety. I tried researching what this could be and I found a lot of anxiety related answers, but those answers described overthinking things and worrying about things, but my thinking processes are not worrisome. My boyfriend asked to see what one of my thought processes was like, so here is an example of a message that I sent him, which is what I was thinking at that moment he asked me: ""You know how we are a physical embodiment of our souls? And people usually consider their physical appearances a big part of their personality? Like the things we wear, piercings, tattoos, and what we do with our hair. That's only a small aspect of our personality, so who are we with out our physical appearances? What does our inner being consist of? Do my opinions make me who I am? In the controversy of abortion, I am pro choice. So is being pro choice a part of who I am? I don't think so because that is an opinion that I have about something in the physical world. If that controversy never existed, who would I be then? Do my values make me who I am? I value my friends and my well being. Does that make me who I am? I don't think so because those are basic human values. I think our inner being consists of something that makes us unique from every other inner human being. If we eliminate all physical properties and all that is left is our souls, then who is my soul and how is it different from everyone else's soul? What if I have it all wrong? What if all of our souls are exactly the same and it is up to the individual to create his/her own unique being? If this was true, then should we be okay with the bad people in this world? For example murderers, they want to be murderers so why would we stop someone from being who they want to be? (I know this sounds horrible, but complete open mindedness is necessary for this topic. I do not agree with murder, this is just for the sake of this example.) But murderers are a product of our society. People are oppressed, abused, or traumatized and become murderers. So in this government, we create murderers and then throw them in jail as punishment for doing something that they found pleasure in. People think that there is only one criminal and one victim, but actually, the murderer is also a victim. A victim of this government. This government is the real criminal (for turning its own citizens to into horrible people), and the prisoners are the victims (because they are bad due to a crappy government) Many prisoners are actually very smart people, and sometimes that is why they are in prison! They are a threat to the government so they find a stupid reason to put the smart people in jail. Smart people end up dying in cells every day. Smart people actually live miserable lives because they know too much about the real world. Smart people are smart enough to realize that being smart isnt all that fun, because you know things that you dont want to know.."" This train of thought continued for about 6 hours and by the end of the night i found myself talking about the multiverse theory. Let me remind you that this started off with the absurdity of astrology and led to the multiverse theory. It happens consistently and even when I am talking to someone, I cannot concentrate on what they say because my mind is too distracted with this thinking. It has come to the point where I get horrible headaches every night and the thinking still doesn't stop and it is starting to worry me. My boyfriend said that I showed incredible analysis and critical thinking but I am actually scared of this and I want it to calm down. Has this happened to anyone else? Is this a mental disorder?

My auditory hallucinations started about 3 years ago, occur 24 hrs a day, and haven't stopped since.  When I was a child, about age 8 I can remember hearing a deep voice in my head, yelling at the top of its lungs something indistinguishable. This happened several times. I remember it was always happened when an incident occured, like If i got in trouble for being disobedient or in high times of stress. I'm curious if this was possibly my schizophrenia rearing it's ugly voice or if I was just making it up. I've heard children have vivid imaginations and can imagine things like this. I had no clue I was going to start hearing voices in my head at age 28. Now thinking back, i remember hearing this evil man 5-10 times. Was this an auditory hallucination? Do people diagnosed with schizophrenia in their 30's have a couple auditory hallucinations in childhood? Also , what I hear now is not what I heard when I was a child.

I had a really bad car accident and then had my first one while driving shortly afterwards. At first, it was just driving in certain situations, but in the next few years other things would trigger it. Not only highways, bridges, tunnels and multi-lane roads, but soon high places, tall buildings (can't even go to the mall 2nd floor) elevators... you get the idea. I went to my regular doctors since the start and was prescribed several things, Lexapro back in high school which at first made me feel really awful and then I couldn't tell it did anything to Zoloft more recently which seemed to very mildly level out some of the extreme anxiety but only mildly after I had increased my dose quite a bit. (I'm not currently taking any meds - I quite about two years ago.)  I did therapy for a while and to be honest, while the lady was nice I already know/knew everything she was telling me due to all the research I've done since I've had this ""condition"" for so long and since my insurance doesn't cover mental health I quit going after a few months.  I have been prescribed Xanax a couple of times in the past, and with the exception of two flights where I asked for a script so I could actually take the trip) I trashed the prescriptions thinking I shouldn't take them.

I have pain on my inner right knee and a protrusion that, to me, feels like a bone that is not on my left leg. The pain was gradual until it started hurting to walk. I have tried to self diagnose and nothing seems to fit my symptoms. I originally thought it was pes anserine bursitis so I thought rest would help, but it has come back anyway and I realize now that the location of my bump is on the joint line and not below so it cannot be pes anserine bursitis. The pain seems to go away after about a week or two of rest. I wish I had taken note the last time but I don't believe the bump ever goes away because it's still there this time even though the pain has started decreasing.  The bump is super hard. I cannot push it in or move it. At the height of my knee pain, it hurts just walking or even laying down and not using it. Once it calms down, it still hurts to press on the bone/lump.  (I live an active lifestyle and lift weights and do cardio regularly. This exacerbated the injury and I stopped doing exercises involving my legs while it was painful. After about a month of not doing anything and I thought it had healed I started lifting heavy again being extremely careful to not overly exert myself and use proper form.

Not sure if this question is going to Dr. Wilson? 2010-2012 I had severe depression after discontinuing (weaning off) four year use of Prozac (which worked well) After two weeks of being completely of liquid prozac tjat I used to wean down I had a horrible treatment resistant depression for two years. I tried many antidepressants and mood stabilizers.  After much research I found articles on Tartive Dysphoria and truly believe that this is what was going on as this depression was beyond description. Regardless my third psych unit stay I was given ECT and it was effective. A wonderful comeback. Althiugh I felt well from the first treatment I received around 6 treatments total. The hospital Psychiatrist insisted that an antidepressant be used and they settled on Parnate. I'd used antidepressants in the past (ppd) and knew when they were working as I'd go from depressed to normal after I started. This time it was a conundrum as I was already well. So I dont even know if it works, although my first few weeks I felt oddly happy and some what irritable as well so Imentioned it to the hospital psychiatrists to see if he might think mania...he didnt say anything so I left it at that. I can eat absolutely anything. I can drink 25 year old scotch. Eat a ton of cheese, aged beef etc. Recently I've had to switch psychiatrists because the one I had seen for 5 years moved. Because of the fact that I have no allergies to tyramine my current Psychiatrist doubts that the drug is even working and would like me to ween off. My fear of course is experiencing what happened after I weaned of prozac then stopped it happening again with parnate.  So my question is, could he be correct that this drug actually is doing nothing for me since I have no, none, nada food, alcohol,beef jerky, smoked whatever allergy  Thank you.",

Mainly somewhere beneath right ribs but has spread to left side at times. Worried its a lung infection as ache feels deeper than rib cage and surface contact doesn't hurt/ isn't sensitive. Seeing doctor on Tuesday - is there anything I can do to prep for this? Travelling away for 2 months in 2 weeks - worried if scans/tests are necessary I wont fit them in.

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/9439/i-have-no-where-else-to-turn-to-any-good-advice-is-welcomed,"I have no where else to turn to, any good advice is welcomed.","Please bear with me, as this is probably going to be a lengthy post. My wife of 17 years suffers from severe depression and anxiety and has since she was a teenager. Our relationship was good for the first couple years and since then its been varying degrees of hell. I love this woman with all of my heart and it hurts me to see her like this. She refuses to get any sort of help and when she does it is because I'm at my wits end and she does it usually try to make me happy or shut me up. When she goes to a Doctor or therapist she is never honest and gives up after a few weeks and never really tries. She says ""why bother, it has never worked in the past and I've seen so many"". Yes she has seen various professionals over the years (most of them before I met her when she was 18) but she never goes through with it. Just gives up and goes back to locking herself in the bedroom and sleeping all day. She is also a type 1 diabetic and is slowly killing herself because she doesn't take care of it. We have two amazing kids that are my, as I call it ""reason why"", my reason for doing anything. I have tried reaching out to crisis or some other forms of that and they just blow me off. They ask if she is suicidal or homicidal. As far as I know she is not actively thinking of it, but she has been near death from her diabetes a few times a year, I tell them. They give a list of phone numbers to what ever doctor's office is sponsored by the state at that point. I think sometimes she may be in the spectrum of bipolar depressive. She is almost always depressed to the point of agoraphobia but then at times she is delusional to where its almost like she thinks everyone else has some sort of serious mental illness. A few years ago she had me convinced I was bipolar and I would see these ""clinic"" type doctors that would not listen to you and you were in front of them for 10 minutes, they would give you a script for whatever the drug reps were pushing and you wouldn't be back for 6-12 months. I have ADHD I've had it for as long as I can remember. When I finally saw a doctor worth anything they recognized that and I've been fine being treated for my ADHD. She is a hypochondriac. She swore up and down she was developing rheumatoid arthritis and went to all these different specialists telling her she does not have that. Her ""joint issues"" were most likely from not being active. To make the point here, she plays the victim and tries to saying I am abusive or something like that. I am not abusive. There have been times where I've tried to leave because our argument is going no where and I just want away from the situation at that moment and shes jumped on my back to try to stop me and she digs her fingernails into whatever she can get them into, and I've called 911 to try to get her help and the police show up first and start on me. I tell them I was trying to leave she jumped on me. I show them the fingernail marks and they've told me to take it easy next time they don't want to arrest me. I've done nothing wrong. For some reason my physical size makes me automatically guilty. I am 6'5"" 250+lbs and she is 5'4"" 120lbs. I have never been abusive to her. I could probably fill the internet with examples so I will put a few more main points here and wait for a reply. She has had minor issues with substance abuse over the years. I grew up in a family full of addicts and can see it from a mile away. I recently had to have major surgery and I busted her stealing my narcotic pain medication (that I only took when I was in too much pain). A few months prior, she was busted stealing pain meds from her mother. She was developing a drinking problem as well as taking loads of OTC allergy medication to ""help her sleep"". When she was caught stealing them from her mother, I told her that she gets no other chances, because for me, doing that is worse than cheating because I know what its like to have addicts in my family. I would never put my kids through that. I was suspicious of her when I caught her within the past 2 weeks so I set her up, by set up I counted what I had when I went to bed and recounted them when I got up. She took 3 that time and for the whole month I was about 15-20 short. After denying it for a few hours she finally admitted to taking a total of 7, from my experience addicts will only admit to the minimum they think the can get away with, usually about half or less of what they actually took. I've seen my share of professionals myself and they tell me that my depression is situational. They say that they cannot tell me to leave my wife that that is up to me, but it would probably be more healthy for myself. Honestly, I do not want to leave my wife. I love her. She is a great woman. I've seen her when she is not depressed. I guess I am in love with that part of her. Leaving her would be the easy way out. I really feel that if I left her (she would go, I'd get the kids and the house is in my name and she also waived her rights when I caught her stealing pain meds from her mother) she will die sooner rather than later. The little bit she does push to try is because I am there to give her as much as a nudge as I can without her shutting down. If I left her she would completely stop taking her insulin all together and die within a few weeks. I would rather suffer with her and have her alive then have her dead and not with me. Sorry so long. I wanted to put 10 times more in. Thank you. I just do not know what I can do. I have tried everything that I know and no one helps.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression , Bipolar Disorder , Personality Disorders"

I have spent my life ""being strong"", putting on a plastic smile and trudging through everything. I am now 47 and too tired to go on. I was not blessed with health. Though I'm a fighter and made a great life for myself with a family and a 25 year career, I have had multiple health issues my entire life - Mitral Valve Prolapse which I'm told is the reason I have Dysautonomia (itself being a wicked condition to deal with), severe degenerative disc disease (5 surgeries with more planned, herniations, fusions, unimaginable pain and restriction of activities that used to bring me some semblance of joy), and IMO the worse of all these hereditary conditions: clinical depression. The depression has been there my whole life, however it would manifest in waves. Most days it would be at a low enough impact that I could push it aside and not think about it, but a wave of severe depression would hit me and last from a couple days up to about a week... always subsiding enough for me to get back into the swing of things. This rollercoaster would always give me hope that it will pass. Over the years the occurrences would growing longer, but I still had hope they'd pass and I'd once again ""feel"" and have motivation. I hit another unprovoked drop in my serotonin almost 2 months ago, and am still incredibly depressed today. I have lost the hope I usually have that it will pass, and am now prepared to see my Dr for a prescription (I tried Cymbalta then Effexor, as well as Sam-E several years ago, only to struggle with the side effects - after nearly 2 years on different meds, I tapered off). To wrap this up so it's not any longer, the only reason I hang on to this miserable life is for the sake of my family, and lately I question if that's even worth it. I feel as though they'd be initially upset, but seeing that I no longer have anything to offer (due to my spine condition, disability, and other health issues), I feel I am more of a burden than a blessing to them. If I can't get some semblance of feeling and motivation back soon, I will need to do something. No one should live like this. Thank you for listening.",Depression

He is nearly a straight A student in advanced AP classes. He is very conscientious about school. He has a strong network of friends and an active social life. His home life is positive but not very communicative. He's been to College orientation and registered for classes for August. He is in his first serious relationship with an 18 year old girl and it is a distant relationship (6 hours apart). They met through a friend. We've met her and investigated her social media and don't see red flags. His friends, to our knowledge, are all good kids. Our son had ADHD as a child and was medicated 3rd grade through 7th grade. Starting in 8th grade we saw signs of improvement and for 8th - 12th grade he was no longer medicated, never required parental oversight for homework and performed well in school with positive teacher feedback. He refers to those years on medication as ""the worst years of his life"" and didn't like his experience with his psychiatrist. He's always had little ""quirks"" about his personality. He is very sensitive if he feels people are making fun of him even if it is intended as a tease. He is very particular about certain things - for example he wanted to know every detail about his graduation party, etc. He also can be very reactive and get angry quickly but that's only with parental interaction.  We woke up early Wednesday morning to a 3am message from his girlfriend asking us to intervene because she had concerns about him harming himself. She indicated that he is depressed and has anxiety and is drinking to ease the pain. In text message conversations with her he questioned his purpose in being here anymore. We took her message extremely seriously and decided to do an ER visit immediately. We woke him up (the same morning of his conversation with her) and said we needed to go to the doctor (did not say why) and we needed his help. Upon arrival and within the safety of the hospital staff we informed him of why we were there. He did not get angry or fight. He looked up to the sky and shook his head as if to say ""what have I done?"" The reaction stuck in our minds. He cried once when he saw his Mom cry. Three hours of nurse, doctor and social worker interaction yielded an opinion of no concern for self-harm. He was adamant to all hospital staff that he would never hurt himself and also adamant that he does not use any substances. He did indicate that he feels that sometimes he has anxiety and that can make him say irrational things. He also discussed his back problems with the ER doctor who offered a pain relief subscription which he refused. We thought that was interesting that if he was abusing substances that he would jump at the chance to obtain some pain medication. The morning of the hospital visit we woke him up within 5 hours of receiving his girlfriend's message. He had no scent of alcohol and woke up easily and without any signs of being intoxicated. We had a family member scour his room while we were at the hospital and there was absolutely no sign of any alcohol. We also scoured his social media accounts, web browsing history, YouTube history and we found nothing concerning at all. We followed up with the girlfriend to try to better understand. She shared screenshots of their conversation. We immediately understood her concern. He definitely told her he was drinking and the text conversation would suggest that he was intoxicated. His messages said things that would lead to questioning his safety. After reading what he actually wrote, we had several conversations with him. Basically, what he says is that when he's alone and not distracted by other things, there's been two occasions where he has developed anxiety about his girlfriend where he obsesses about where she is, who she's with, does she love him, etc., and that anxiety leads to him saying irrational things. Those are his words. He calls what he says irrational. The day this occurred, he was experiencing back problems and was home without friends, on his back in bed from 8:30pm on. The girlfriend's message came in at 3:00am.  It's almost like he wants to draw her in and thrives on the attention that his irrational thoughts generate. We're two days later now and things are completely normal. He's been out with friends to a movie, playing sports and swimming. We don't think we would ever get him to a mental health doctor without a significant confrontation because of his association of all doctors of that type to his ADHD years. We're not sure whether to be relieved or scared. We don't know what to do at this point.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression , Self Harm , Substance Abuse"

She has said she felt forced to marry me; and she has said she did not love me. We have always had an argumentative relationship and she goes to some dark corner of her mind and hangs out. But now, it has finally sucked me down, too.   I can never do anything without her finding fault with it. I try to do things to make her smile and she only gripes about it. She craves people liking her so much that she has ended up allowing other men to flirt with her and when I have found out, she's gotten mad at me!   I have been in ill health for 11 years now, and am no longer able to operate in this horrible situation! My illness keeps me from getting more than 3-4 hours sleep a night, and that is divided into 2-3 segments.   And to make it worse, I was a pastor until I had to quit due to my health.   I now find myself wanting to either divorce and live alone in a studio apartment, or even die. (I am being checked now for prostate cancer.) I can't even enjoy my grown kids anymore - and I know it is not all her fault, but I do find myself hating to interact or be with her because she will start another negative or start a fight. I will not commit suicide, but I do not feel any reason to live. I hate to complain or whine, but that's all I do in my mind anymore. What can I do?",

Weirdest is that my hand will feel freezing cold, then, awhile later, very hot. The pain usually wakes me up at night and will subside enough to get back to sleep after about 20 minutes.

Other times it hurts to walk so badly that I have to limp around school and look like a complete idiot. My left leg will also get numb sometimes. I’ve gone to the doctors so many times that I feel like they think I’m just lying at this point, and my dad says I’m a hypochondriac. I thought being diagnosed would help me feel better but it hasn’t. I am also overweight, which I know is a contributing factor to my pain (and I’m slowly but surely working on losing that extra weight, I have depression so it isn’t that easy). I know there is something else that is going on. I just feel like I’ve been incorrectly diagnosed.  So, here are my main questions. What are some things I can do to stop the pain?

As long as I can remember, I have been terrified of needles because of the pain they cause me. I also replay the injection over and over in my head after it happens, which doesn't help things. But I have noticed something interesting... I seem to find larger needles less painful than thinner ones. For example, I had to have a minor operation on my finger due to a sliver under my nail. The doctor used a large gauge needle to inject the anesthetic. I felt the needle go in as the medicine took a while to work (and burned like heck), but it felt like he was just pressing a toothpick on my skin. Not painful, just annoying. That same day, I received a Tetanus shot through a smaller needle, and the thing hurt like heck.  I recently got a TB test, and it hurt so badly I nearly cried. I had my navel pierced with a 15 gauge needle and I only felt the cold of the needle. No sharp pricking pain. So I guess my question is, has anyone else experienced this? Why do bigger needles cause less pain for me? And to help with the phobia, can I request the largest needle possible for procedures?",

Combine that with an insurance company that doesn't want to really pay for anything and I'm pretty much left with PM. I've done years of PT, tried every over the counter or non-narcotic medicine they've suggested and the only thing that seems to work has been Oxycodone. I'm on 15 mg 4x/day.

I have mentioned to him that on weekends that I have big shoots (I'm a sports photog) that I do use more than 4/day. I've never been anything less than candid with him and haven't had an issue until now. I seem to be developing a tolerance to the medicine and it's no longer as effective as it was.

I was going to call and talk to a nurse, but the office he is at was recently bought out by another company and the phone number I had for him no longer worked.

I really like every single person in their office except for one particular nurse and of course she's the one that's going to administer the count this afternoon.

He wanted me to have a baby for her and I said no. There was nothing wrong with her. What I didn't realize was that the baby would be for them, it would not be decent for them to have a baby together. We did have a son, which was mentally challenged. I was mentally abused, always degrading me, he didn't want me to see my family or friends, literally no social life, very controlling, by my husband. His mom, dad and sister put me down too. All I was good for was to work and pay bills with my paycheck. I did an overdose of pain pills for headaches, I just wanted to die. I felt worthless. My husband tried to get me to beat my son with a belt, but I wouldn't so he took my son to the bedroom and started to beat him. I jumped on top of my son and told my husband if he ever hit him again that he would never see my son again. My husband took him out of afterschool daycare and let my husband's mom and dad and sister take care of him. I threw myself into work and went back to school at night so I could get a job to make enough money to leave. There were times that I felt like he was trying to kill me. I would feel electrical current when I would shower, my tires would be loose for no reason on several occasions, my car would have problems for no reason. The years went by and finally got the nerve to leave, but my son was too old to force to go with me. Though the years my son had become more and more defiant towards me. After I left, my son almost died from appendicitis, his dad was too stingy to take him to the doctor. I found out by his teacher. His dad had been keeping me from seeing my son. I finally got a ""sorry lawyer"" to get me visitation rights, but no overnight stays. More years passed and my ex died. Well finally my son and I would be together. NO. My ex's sister turned my son against me and told the court that I beat my son. He will not have anything to do with me. It has been over seven years since I have hugged or talked with him. He aunt died and her other brother won't bring us back together. He is afraid I will get some land or money. I was abused by my dad when I was a baby, my mother took me to my grandmother and went back to my dad. He would beat my brothers till they were black and blue. So you see I would never beat my son.

I took it, and it did it's job. When I see him, he says, ""Lets take a urine test!"" He hadn't taken one from me in a year. Well, 2 days later, his nurse calls me, and says Dr Morganstein is dismissing you. ""Where'd you get the Suboxone from?"". I told her, ""from doing a guy a favor, and as he was leaving the car, he tossed into my lap. She said, ""well, that's illegal, and Dr Morganstein doesn't want anything to do with it."". I asked, ""may I come in and explain to him the circumstances?. She said, ""No, once your dismissed, you cannot see him again... Phew. Now on March 7th, I'm moving a few counties to the east to a beautiful apt. I must obtain all new doctors. Now, when I try to get a new Pain doc, they're going to request my records....A nurse from my insurance company advised me at that point, to explain what occurred.

I have fibromalgia and arthritis. I have the pain from fibromyalgia for 25 years and arthritis pain 1 year. On Vicodin and later oxy. For 23 years I took 120 mg of Vicodin then oxy daily. 1 1/2 years ago I decided to get off oxy. The reason to get off was opoid induced constipation. First I could not go.Then when I was able to go it was hard as concrete. I flushed off and on for 3 hours, and it would not bend and go down the toilet. Finally I put on a pair of gloves pulled it out and put it in a zip lock bag and into the garbage. That scared the hell out of me. It was at that time I new I had to get off of opioids.For the last year and a half I have been trying to get off of oxy.First I tried cold turkey. That lasted 4 days and five nights. The stomach pain was more than I could take. So I told the clinic I want to cut me back each month so I could get off of this drug. Four months in a row same amount of mg of oxy. So the third month I cut myself back. When I went in 2 weeks ago I asked for clonidine. Clonidine is a highblood pressure med. The clinic gave me .1 mg clonidine. I knew from talking to pharmacy I needed .2 mg. Clinic said since I was taking 15 mg a day I should not have withdrawals. Wrong. Then he gave me 2 scripts oxy 112 pills each month. Plus Tramadol a non opoid pain killer. I went to another doctor and got the right amount of clonidine. Today is 13 days of no opoids. The clonidine was a big big help I could not hav e done it with out it. I asked the check in lady how many people come in daily she said 125-150 People a day 5 days a week. Plus she said they had two other clinics all so 125-150 a day. I did the math. $300x125 per day/5 days then add two more clinics doing the same. These pill mills are making a fortune. This guy that wrote the script tried to get me to do methadone when that did not work he threw out 2 more opoid pain killers. It was then that I realized this pill mill did not want me to get off off opioids. The tramdol is not a opoid BUT it goes to the same transmitters as the opoids. So I stand a good chance of addiction with Tramadol. The clinic never told me addiction Tramadol. I went on the net and found this out. When I am done with withdrawals I have a few natural pain killers to try. So only time will tell if I will stay clean.Good luck to all. You never know what u can do till u try.

It began when I was carrying heavy backpack in the mountains for months at a time. When I arrived back home, my pain was present but it was not as intense as it is now. I also began working immediately in a job where i was standing or sitting still, and my neck was always looking down. Moreover, I have been going to school which doesn't help the situation either. I have had X-rays and bone density scans, both of which have come out negative, I have also had blood tests to rule out arthritis which also came out negative. To try and help, I have seen physics, massage therapists, manual therapists and chiropractors all of which have told me a variety of things. Some say stretch, some say don't, some say exercise, some say don't. I have been seeing a manual therapist who has been doing IMS which seems to relieve the intensity of the pain but comes back a few days later. I have also only started taking ibuprofen so I can't tell for sure how much the IMS is working or not. I have only been doing the IMS for 5 weeks and I understand that chronic pain is a slow recovery process, but what I haven't receiced is a sure fire answer as to what the issue may be. I am an extremely active person, however with this injury, I am unable to do the things I want to do, and I am constantly thinking and worrying about the pain.

I avoided certain people (usually those in authority), and found it safest to avoid any situation which would bring on an attack. A psychiatrist prescribed Rivotril (I think it is referred to as Clonazepam as well) - 0.5mg twice daily. My life changed dramatically, i had finally become the person i was meant to be - i went back to university, acted on my dream and started my own business and best of all I stood up for myself and could look people in the eye. What an empowering feeling - I felt alive, and nothing will hold me back. Yesterday, it felt like my world had come crashing down around me when i read that Benzodiazepines cause brain damage and dementia. The side effects were mentioned - depression, suicidal thoughts, heart palpitations, insomnia, etc., and yes I have had them all but that was before i was taking Rivotril. Rivotril took all that away. The only side effect I experience now is loving life. I have been taking them for 4 years and i have never altered the dose or needed to. I am petrified, I do not want to have to go back to being that person who skimmed around the edge of an existence but i also don't want to damage my brain or increase the risk of dementia - I am a mom to teenagers who need me.

However, the next morning, the one side of my neck was swollen and my shoulder was quite sore. I visited the chemist who said I ought to go see a doctor. So, off to the doctor I went the next day. By then the swelling and pain was less but still present. My doctor informed me that it may just been because of the sudden movement of my head to the one side and gave me inflammation tablets. After 3 days of these it went away and I thought right, it was nothing. But soon realized I was wrong. After about two months the swelling and pain came back and with a vengeance. So, back to the doctor I went. After quite some arguments, he sent me for X-rays but couldn't find anything out of place. I was them sent for acupuncture. This was a nightmare, the needles bend completely and afterwards the pain was worst, my neck actually made a big bulge. So, no more of that I said. I started taking ibuprofen which helps ease the pain but knew I couldn't stay on it forever. I requested a second opinion and was sent for an MRI which also showed no issue. Then I was sent for normal physiotherapy which did assist with the issue and for a long time everything seemed normal. Yet, this was all about 4 years back and every now and then it would come back, I'd drink ibuprofen and it would go. The last time was about 8 months back and I thought, well, eventually it is gone.

Doctor prescribed Ibuprofen and referred me to a hand specialist.  Fast forward to today, I saw the specialist and he tells me there's nothing for them to do, the only thing I can do is let it heal. He tells me to stop wrapping it because preventing movement will keep it from healing. I tell him I wrap it because if I don't, and my wrist moves the wrong way, I feel my bone pop and the pain is excruciating, and then it swells. He basically tells me to get over it. He also advises me not to take pain meds. My wrist has been in pain for going on 4 months now... I feel like this is the worst medical advice I've ever been given.

With the current emphasis on the opioid epidemic/crisis, which I deem to be more political rather than medically motivated, I see a number of people being denied access to this class of drugs even through they have been longer-term users based on legitimate, physically documented conditions. To me, and like me, I do not believe that most such people are addicted to nor abuse the medication. If anything, they are addicted to pain relief, if you will. They may indeed be dependent on the drug both physically and mentally. But these people appear to be lumped into the abuser and addicted class, and are progressively or even dramatically cut off from access to these drugs because of physician fear of prosecution for dispensing them.  Yes, we care and are concerned about the overdose deaths and the overuse of these drug, but so little seems to be being done comparatively to support those in significant chronic pain. The alternatives being offered to narcotic pain relievers are, in my opinion, woefully inadequate. I suppose this may seem like somewhat of a rant, and I guess it is, but I do have a question here. What are the potential significant risk-related adverse effects, either mentally or physically, to rather high dosage levels of narcotics over longer periods of time? Does the drug itself pose or cause additional physical ailments above and beyond those for which the person is being treated? In my case, I am prescribed 10mg hydrocodone taken (as needed) every 6 hours.",

This is my first post and I am looking for some kindred folk who may have experienced what I am experiencing. I have had a dull ache between my shoulder blades (interscapular) for three months (since end of October), primarily on my dominant (right) side. I have taken very conservative treatment options (three visits to a physiotherapist in past three weeks and use of NSAIDs, such as Aleve on a sporadic basis) because I do not exhibit any of the warning (red flag) symptoms that should compel an immediate visit to a physician (no weakness or numbness, no fever, no swelling, no night sweats, no pain waking me at night, etc). Also, my physician is 25 miles away in my former hometown, which makes it a bit more difficult to make the trip. I did go to a walk-in clinic in early December, as this all seemed to start with a mild bronchitis which caused a lot of coughing and subsequent intercostal rib ache along with corresponding ache in the upper back. I thought that with the cough getting better the ache would go away soon after, and that physician confirmed that he thought this was what was causing the problem and ""not to worry"". Fast forward another 7 weeks or so, and the ache is pretty much there all the time. It is not enough to stop me from working or doing every-day tasks, and is not affected by movement, but I'm always thinking about it. The characteristics of this discomfort are the following - dull ache just below the scapula and primarily on the right side; ache that sometimes goes into the scapula and can refer to the middle of the back (spine) at times; ache is generally unaffected by movement, though there is corresponding stiffness; corresponding ache in right shoulder (started about a month ago, and compounded by my stupid decision to go to a rock climbing gym with my son); sometimes the ache goes into the upper right arm above the elbow (this only started a couple of weeks ago).  I find relief only with three things. 1. Moist heat (like the hot tub) is a saving grace; 2. Vigorous exercise; 3. Sleep. It is better when I am lying down, but pretty much there all the time when I am up and taking part in daily activities. I also do a fair amount of stretching and have done some yoga. My physiotherapist, whom I have only started seeing three weeks ago thinks I have major muscle stress and trigger points, which might be the cause of the problem. He says my upper back is ""hard as a brick wall"" and says that this has been going on for so long that it could be another 4-6 months before it is finally better. I do have an office-type job where I spend a lot of time sitting in meetings and in front of a computer monitor. I have been trying to monitor posture and take regular breaks to walk around. My physiotherapist says there is better movement each time he sees me, but that the pain or ache is always the last thing to go. While I don't discount his professional opinion, and hope he is right (except for the lengthy healing process), I am wondering if I might have a nerve impingement thing going on (perhaps dorsal scapular syndrome or something like that), osteoarthritis, a disc problem, or something more ominous?!  The ache has not been getting worse, but is not really improving. However, some days it does feel improved (after the first visit to the physio, I felt good relief for about three days). I have not yet had x-ray or CAT scan, but will do that soon if there is no noticeable improvement. Any advice that you can offer is most appreciated.",

First started with some low back pain and some disc problems. Spinal stenosis. I have arthrititis through my body. Also signs of M.S. Being told 20 years ago I have it. My spinal tap won't show the rings. Other stuff in my spinal fluid like very high protein. Those problems I have to deal with when they come. The rings that show up in spinal fluid is because autoimmune problem won't let me fight inflammation anymore because of this in my spine. I had one pain specialist that fracture my spine in 4 places showing me these parts of my spine problems with these twists. Felt something in the 3rd twist. Percocet wore off and more pain I didn't want. Next pain specialist gave me an injection in buttock area. Doctor was interupted during this and forgot the second numbing shot. Felt like a 6 inch nail went in my poor crippled and hurting body severely stiffen and I learned tears can actually shoot out like bullets. NO more needles and no more steroids because I am diabetic.Steroids were messing with me so bad my PC doctor had to call them and said no more steroids. After that my orthodedic doctor found me another doctor. I had a really bad fall 3 years ago.Top of back foot stepping went completely under a mat. When my back foot let loose I went straight down into hard packed dirt. I was in wheelchair for 5 months. All the injuries were multiple lower fracture ribs and cartledge, hairline fracture in tibia, my spine went out like an accordin and when I hit it came back in. Torn meniscus in each knee and fluid in the one knee made a 2mm cyst go up to 78 mm and needed drained 4 times. Now it gets big and drain on it's own. Spine injury never stopped. Right arm was severely bruise as my right shoulder that can be painful. I have spinal stenosis in spine and neck also. Found out during this time I have scoliois at a number where 2 more numbers that it will need to be treated. Will know soon if the scoliosis was from fall, that can happen. Never felt it till after the fall. So where was I with pain control? My orthopedic was limited to percocet and I was taking ten mil. every 6 hours. Still screamed and cried alot and he sent me to pain specialist. Yea the one who is forgetful giving injections. He was trying differant meds and it was rather they wouldn't work or had a bad reaction. Doesn't matter what is going on you had to wait for your next appt for the month. I cried so much and call them after holding my spine over from pain balling my eyes out for four hours and office said wait till your appt. I had what the nurse call like phantom pain. I really actually had thoughts of using a chainsaw and cut my knees off and stepping in front of a moving car thinking it would stop the pain. It was horrible. I cried and moaned and up hours at night from the pain. This went on for 2 1/2 years. I don't know even how I even went through it. That doctor was putting me on meds that were not helping at very small doses because of this scare. This new doctor put me on 10 mil. of Opana 12 hour. I tell you what.....I had release of pain. It was sooooo like night and day. I do not know how I even did it for that long suffering like that. The medicine last for 8 hours not twelve. So four hours during sleep I can wake up with pain but I get through nights being I am laying down. Four hours during day can be brace or heating pad. I really don't mind that because so much of the pain was killed. Recently went to my orthopedic doctor and he said he seen things in my spine has been progressly getting worse last two years from tests I had . He said I needed surgery and then said BIG surgery. OK...I needed surgery on my knees and it would not be done because my sleep doctor stated I was to have no surgery unless it was no other choice that has to be done. I have sleep apnea and central sleep apnea where I stop breathing 98 time an hour. Brain won't tell me to breathe when sleeping. See surgeon on February first. IDK. Ortho doctor said I would end up in wheelchair. Then 2 years after the fall I was driving and stopped behind a car that was turning left and I looked in my rear view mirror and seeing this jeep vehicle coming real fast and as I turned my head to tell my husband this man hit us speeding and there was no skid marks. My husband and I had both grabbed our necks. My spinal stenosis was so bad and for an hour and half could feel things moving in my neck. It ended up disc hit and pinched nerve and knock disc and hit spinal cord and it bled a little bit. I never had pain in my neck. Just bothersome one time when talking to my son with my head turned. Now the breakthrough of pain with that is a differant pain I do not want. Yes I need surgery on a disc that moved. Not going to happen right now. Surgeon said if I start losing things dropped in hand or losing feeling surgery will have to be done right away or it will never get it back. It is not very good right now. Get brain attacks that is painful. Have 10 plus lesions. Neuro problems that go with that. I tell you what.........I pray that no one else has to go through this with this medication problem caused by other people. It is coming into this country. It was inhumane to let me suffer so bad. People that was dying from herione with Fentanyl made a choice, A very sick choice. I am not understanding it, A mother died here in our city at Childrens Hospital. Her child was very sick. Both parents used up in bathroom and mother died in there. A newspaper story where parents used up and both died upstairs and they were found a week later and their 6 month old baby was found dead in bassinet. Parents found pulled over somewhere OD or passed out with there children just sitting there. One guy in our city used and decided he felt so good he could speed in his car which caused a horrible crash where a little child was toss out of the car and was moved out of the car seat and rolled on the pavement. It is all sad and there is people going crazy now it seems for narcotics. Unfortunate people need medication. There has to be a line drawn on peoples conditions that show on their medical records. I would also say keep urine testing. It is pure inhumane what was happening to me.",

I currently do not know what type of depression I am experiencing, but I suspect it is ether Clinical Depression or Dysthymia. The only problem I find with Dysthymia is that it is supposed to be mild with only 2 or 3 symptoms, whereas I am experiencing far more. I've taken ten different online tests and every one came back as my level being severe or extremely severe. My symptoms are; persistent sadness, emptiness, worthless, hopelessness, low self-esteem, and guilty feelings; Fun stuff like reading and drawing are not interesting; I can sleep for 12+ hours and still be tiered with feelings of fatigue and decreased energy; I overeat a lot and have noticed a gain in weight; everything seems hard, even the dishes; My memory sucks, along with my concentration; I get irritated easily; making decisions are difficult. Nothing has changed in the last several years, there are no 'good' days, nor any 'bad' ones. They are all the same, just that gaping hole of nothing all the time, every day, 24-7, for years and years. Thankfully, I haven't been cutting, nor am suicidal. I have heard of double depression and it might be a possibility. I also suffer from social anxiety, if that makes a difference.

I'm still crying and overly emotional and listless and all the things that go with Depression. The doctor explained, and I remember from previous incidents, that the medication is not immediately effective. It will be at least a couple weeks before I really even start to feel any different. I have had Depression for over 40 years, it hit me around puberty. I stupidly and routinely in the past have gone off my medications at some point, and after some time had a major relapse. Though so far I have had no actual suicide attempts, I have gotten very very very close, including this week. I'm lucky in that for me, starting to get help does actually help - I know the medication has not kicked in (it's only been a couple hours) but just knowing that it's coming has become the light at the end of the tunnel. At least there's that. I'm also ""lucky"" in that mostly my Depression is most definitely organic, though I've also had and have situational Depression, the medication helps to keep things to a level I can get back to life and _almost_ deal with the situational things. I live a fairly sedentary and isolated life. I have few nearby friends, none of whom can really deal with my being Depressed, which has isolated me further. I have been trying and am now trying much harder, to remedy that. I'm not social, but I'm at least going to be forcing myself into situations where I can be around others. I'm jobless, which really doesn't help matters, but even going to read at the library can help. Somewhat surprisingly, MeetUp is being a help there too.

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/7955/always-hope,Always HOPE,"Many of us reach a point in life, where we don't see a reason to continue on. No matter what the cause is for reaching this hopelessness, we cannot find any glimmer of light to sustain a desire to live. I have suffered at that point, on numerous occasions. I grew up with a narcissistic mother. Her entire focus in life was her own image. In my first semester of college, when I was brutally attacked and raped after having a few drinks at a party, her only response was, ""Well, did you learn your lesson about drinking?"". After begging for months to see someone for help, to no avail, I developed an eating disorder, as the only means to control my fear and emotions. According to her, I was then weak and disgusting. I struggled to live day to day, to become independent, to build a career, to carry on healthy relationships. But I could never fully fight off the demons in my thoughts. After the death of my father in 2004, and the loss of my job, I had a complete mental breakdown. Yet again, rather than finding me the appropriate help and support, my mother saw this as an opportunity. Now, knowing it as Munchausen-By-Proxy, she used my weakened mental and emotional state, to her benefit. She convinced me I was physically sick, even disabled, and needed to be on medication. She played the manipulative game with doctors and pharmacies all over the area, to acquire incredible amounts of barbiturates, benzodiazepines, narcotics, and anything else she could get her hands on. The number of medications I was taking, the extremely dangerous doses of each, and frequency she gave them to me, very well should have killed me. Instead, I spent the decade I lived under her control, in a wheelchair, with the extent of my activity being moving from my bed, to the couch for the day, and then back to bed at night. For a number of those years, my breathing was so suppressed from the drugs and side effects, I was on oxygen 24/7. My mother's story was always, ""My poor daughter is so sick, and no one can figure out what is wrong with her. She is in so much pain, and nothing relieves it at all. I have given up MY life to care for her, as she will never recover. I am her mother, so it is what I must do"", all the while putting another pain patch on me, and shoving another fistful of pills into my mouth. She had convinced me as well, that I would never recover in any way, and that once she could no longer care for me, I would be put into a home. I had no reason, nor desire, to live that way any longer. None. Then, one day, in her constant search for new doctors and new prescriptions, I ended up at one of the most prestigious hospitals in the United States. I found out later on, that they recognized the entire situation as abuse, on the day I was admitted. On that day, my doctors told me I would walk out of that hospital healthy one day. My mother and I both laughed in their face. They continued to tell me that everyday, and for the first month, my response was either, ""You're full of ***!"", or ""*** You!""  Then one day, the attending doctor came over to me, stood right in front of me, and said, ""Get up, and walk down that hallway!"" I shared a few choice words with him, and laughed at his suggestion. He repeated himself, took the walker in front of me, and literally threw it across the hallway. As I looked on in disbelief, he said once more, ""Get up, and walk down that hallway."" The resident that had been standing next to him, came to my side and took my arm. He helped me out of my wheelchair, and held my arm as I slowly walked around the entire unit. Upon my return to the wheelchair, the attending simply said, ""See? I told you that you will walk out of here!"". For the first time ever, I had a glimpse of hope . . . that what I always believed to be impossible, might in fact be, possible. The doctors kept me inpatient for 6 months, always telling my mother that I was still too sick to go home, but all the while, protecting me from her until I was well. In those 6 months, I went through the grueling process of detoxing from all of the medications, went through daily physical therapy to teach my body how to work again, and spent every day in intensive cognitive therapy to challenge, and eventually change, the thoughts I had been not only told over the past decade, but throughout my entire life.  That was just FOUR years ago. In these past four years, the struggle has been enourmous. But I have always kept HOPE as my guiding light, and the fuel to my motivation. I have learned to live each and every day as it comes. I cannot change the past, nor can I predict the future, so I choose to stay only in the moment. I have been blessed to have the utmost support from my brothers and extended family, and have the best friends one could ever wish for.  Now, four years after being wheeled into a hospital unit, I am completely independent - living on my own, working full time, eating well and exercising, paying my own bills, spending time with friends and family, and even dating. I have severed all ties, and neither I, or any of my immediate or extended family, have had any contact with my mother in two years. I am healthy - in every true sense of the word. I am happy! I love being around people, am confident in who I am, and love to laugh more than anything. I believe in kindness, and love, and that we as humans are here to support each other.  I often wonder, ""What if?"" What if I had died in her ""care""? What if I had taken my own life, as I so many times planned? And the only response I ever can muster is, ""then look what I would have missed out on"". I have so much more life to live, and every opportunity is open to me! I want to try everything there is to do! I want to experience life in every possible way! It is about time, now at 44 year old, that I begin to LIVE! HOPE. Anything is possible. Things can change any day. We never know when or how, but we all need to be open to the opportunity. I am not a religious person, but I DO believe in miracles. I have lived one, and am oh so proud. HOPE. Tomorrow is a brand new day. HOPE ""She believed she could, so she did!""","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Abuse Victims , Depression , Eating Disorders , Self Harm , Personality Disorders"

I was in grad school at the time, and the stress levels were extreme. I was seeing a psychiatrist at my school, and he prescribed me to Prozac, which lifted me out of my depression and shot me into a crazy manic phase... I stole from people, racked up over $20,000 in debt, followed people, saw the CIA following me, followed cops, was arrested a few times, constantly carried a gun, alienated almost all my friends....somehow by the grace of God graduated with my masters and got a job in Michigan at an auto OEM After a year at the company, I bought a motorcycle and stopped taking my meds because I didn't think I needed them. Two months later, I'm riding south with two ounces of marijuana and my pistol, when I'm hit by another driver. This resulted in another TBI and a nice felony charge - which eventually was reduced to a misdemeanor. So I kept my job. However, I decided to get right back on medications in case the depression came back. It has been a long recovery process, but the deep depression I felt before never returned. Two days this week, I've forgotten to take my morning medications. Over the course of the day, I was noticeably more cheerful, thoughtful, enthusiastic, engaged.

My name is Nicole and I'm 27 years old. I'd like to tell my story and possibly get feedback from you... My maternal grandmother committed suicide when I was 10 years old. Nowadays, my doctors believe the trauma of losing my grandmother may have sort of jump started my depression. She was the first person close to me that I had ever lost and I didn't understand depression and suicide at the time. I've always felt guilty about my grandma's death, like maybe I could have done something to save her. I know logically that I didn't do anything wrong and my grandma knew I loved her, but it doesn't prevent me from feeling this way. At the age of 14, I attempted suicide for the first time. I didn't understand why I was in so much pain and hated my life so much and depression never crossed my mind. My mom found me and I was rushed to the hospital. I survived and was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. The doctors started me on medication and I started going to therapy. It was around the age of 16 that I was diagnosed with anorexia and exercise bulimia after I went to the doctor because I hadn't had a period in over 6 months. I was obsessed with being skinny and I've always had a distorted view of my appearance. Not long after being diagnosed, my eating seemed to return to a more normal state. About a year later, my mom caught me before I could attempt suicide again and I was taken to the hospital. At about this time, my eating patterns had flipped and I was diagnosed with binge eating disorder. I gained around 40 pounds my senior year of high school. My high school didn't want to allow me to graduate because I had missed 2/3 of the school year in absences, but my parents managed to change their mind. During all my school years, it was readily apparent that I was a perfectionist. I was incredibly smart and I was in all advanced placement courses. I was also obsessed with being perfect, so I was never skinny enough, never smart enough, never good enough in general. For example, I scored a 34 (out of 36) on my ACTs and I was so upset with myself. I had convinced myself that a perfect score may not be reasonable, so I decided I would be satisfied with a 35. I've also set very high goals and standards for myself, which I believe tend to backfire. After high school, I wanted to go to college so badly and I thought that everything would change once I did, but I was wrong. I didn't even make it three months into the school year before I had to withdraw and return home. About 3 or 4 years ago, I was in a emotionally and physically abusive relationship that has really impacted me. About two years ago, I attempted suicide again. My dad found me and again, I was rushed to the hospital and I survived. During these past 17 years, I've tried what feels like every medication possible. I've gone through numerous therapists and I have now been seeing the same one for the past two years on a weekly basis. I've also tried acupuncture. I've gone through eating disorder treatment. I was in a DBT group. I tried ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) and it seemed to work at first. However, after several months of treatments, I no longer noticed any positive results and I had suffered significant memory loss, so my doctors decided I should stop treatment. Presently, I am suffering from major treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and binge eating disorder. I'm also on medical leave from my job. I have gained about 100 pounds over a period of 7 months and just last week, started therapy at an eating disorder facility, where I will also see a dietician on a weekly basis. There is a binge eating group coming up June at the eating disorder facility and I'm pretty sure I'm going to do that. The memory loss from ECT has greatly effected my condition. My long term memory feels like its been wiped clean and I struggle with my short term memory. My mom is just about the only support system that I have (although my brothers and dad would be there for me if I asked them or if I needed them) besides my doctors because I've really isolated myself from what few friends I have lately. I'm in such a dark place, but I've been managing to keep going. My two main goals in life were to have my grandpa walk me down the aisle for my wedding and to have a baby girl, which I would name after my grandpa and grandma, and she would be able to meet my grandpa. I wanted to be able to show her a picture of them together when she got older while I tell her stories about him and what a great man he was. When I was in town for my grandma's funeral, my grandpa had taken me for a walk outside his apartment. My cousin was getting married a month later and had been asking my parents if they would be back for the wedding. While on the walk, I asked my grandpa if he would be at my wedding and he promised me he would. I asked him if he'd walk me down the aisle and he said yes. Ever since then, that had been my dream. I've actually been dreaming a lot about my wedding lately and the only clear part of my dreams was my dad pushing my grandpa in his wheelchair down the aisle while I held his hand. It really helped me believe that I could get through this and it gave me something to work for. I knew my grandpa was getting older, but I had convinced myself he would hang on until he walked me down the aisle like he promised. My grandpa died yesterday. I've already recognized that my high school dreams of going to college and becoming extremely successful in a legal or psychological field among many other dreams are, perhaps, not realistic at this time. I feel okay about it, but yesterday, my remaining dreams and goals were crushed. My grandpa was such an important part of my life and I loved him so much. He was also the main reason I hadn't attempted suicide - I didn't want him to have to go to my funeral. I'm so lost and hurt right now. Lately, I've been considering TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) and Ketamine infusion, but I'm still in the research phase. My weekly therapy appointments haven't been helping as much lately and I've started eating disorder treatment because my therapist doesn't feel equipped enough to handle my eating and body image issues. My psychiatrist has been weaning off my medication one at a time because she thinks I'm suffering from Serotonin Induced Apathy and she plans on starting completely new on medication after she takes me off all the ones I'm taking now (I'm at maximum dosages of all my medications). My grandpa's death is a major blow to my state of mind right now. I want to pull through, I want to get better, I want to have a normal, healthy life and be happy, but I'm so confused as to how to get there and right now, I'm in so, so, so much pain. I feel like I've tried just about all of the possible treatments and medications and I'm still so depressed. I was wondering if anyone knows of any other treatments that have been successful for them or others? Any really helpful tools or suggestions? I'm really desperate at this point.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression , Eating Disorders"

Kyphosis which causes me upper back pain/ DDD L5/S1 with a herniation to the right/polyneuropathy in both legs.......ON SSDI since 2003 for chronic pain. (You need real solid documentation from doctors to get that). After 20 years on long-acting narcotics, last January 2017, my prescription insurance changed, and my copay went from $1.50 a script to $100 per script. At that time, I was one Opana ER and Opana IR. I felt I needed to choose one or the other. I chose the Opana IR. It was {5} 10mg pills. From 6am to 10pm, they were gone. I'd go to bed, and very often wake in the 2-3am range in a lot of pain , take a 6th pill, and get back to sleep. I knew I'd be ""light"" at the months end, but I'd tough it out, then ask him to put me back on the Opana ER.  ~~~Here's the worst part~~. A month before even meeting the doctor, Oct 2015, I did a guy a favor and gave him a ride to work. Wasn't gonna ask for nothing..As he's leaving the vehicle, he tosses something into my lap, says thanks, and exits the car. I pick it up, and it said ""suboxone"". At that time, I didn't know it was a controlled substance, but I heard of it, so I took it home, seen what its for, and said to myself, ""this may come in handy someday, and put it in my jewelry box, where it sat a year and a half. 4 days before seeing the doctor, on the 2nd day, withdrawal hits, so I remember I had the suboxone, and took it.  When I got to my appointment the doctor says, ""Let's do a urine test""..... 2 days later his nurse calls and say, ""the doctor is dismissing you, where did you get the suboxone?""  I told her how it was given to me without me asking for it by the guy I gave a ride to. She says, ""well, it's illegal, and the doctor wants nothing to do with that.""  I asked if I can meet him, and explain why I was short & how I obtained the suboxone? The answer was ""NO, once your dismissed, you can't see the doctor again. He'll give you a 10 day supply and a paper with other doctors names. It'll be ready for you tomorrow, so you can come in tomorrow and pick it up."" How in the world am I going to get in front of another doctor now, when they read the reason for my dismissal? I tried 2, and both times a nurse would call and say, ""I'm sorry, the doctor doesn't feel you'd be a good candidate!"" SO people out there ! What the heck am I supposed to do now? I really would appreciate input. You can also email me at fep906@gmail.com Thank You if you read this long post....",

I can't turn my head or lift my head if I'm lying down. I'm pretty sure it's the big neck veins that got messed up, so I'm wondering if this'll be, like, any lasting damage? Are my veins bruised on the inside even though I can't see anything? Are they gonna be weakened forever now or something 'cause of one lousy chokehold?

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/32564/chronic-pain-nightmare,Chronic Pain Nightmare,"I'm in need of some insight, thoughts, ideas or pretty much anything at this point. I can't take it anymore. I'm an Expat living in Japan. We have socialized health care, so I can go to a wide range of clinics, pharmacies, and hospitals for a hell of a lot lower price than if I were back in the States. But I feel like the service is terrible and the doctors more-a-less make me feel like they just want you to keep coming back for months and months, rather than fix the problem as quickly as possible. A year ago, upon waking up one morning, my neck was in extreme pain. Moving it, turning my head and pretty much doing anything was impossible without hurting. Spent a day or two on Ibuprofen and relaxing to see if it went away, but didn't. Pain stayed in my neck and then slowly continued down to my shoulder, and bicep. Throbbing, pulsing pain. Retreated back to shoulder and neck. Then back down the arm all the way to my hand/fingers (hand felt tingling, asleep). Went to a nearby clinic. Explained the amount of time this was going on and all the symptoms and pain(s). He took some x-rays and found out I basically had a compressed disk in my neck. And this is what was causing the pain. Was given some meds and told to rest. Not much more I could do as it would work itself out in time. Within the next month, the right arm pain went away, but then switched to my left arm. Same pain, same progressive path of neck, shoulder, bicep, forearm. Go back to the same clinic. Told to do neck stretches and some other exercises at home. Didn't help. Meds didn't do anything. Pain remained. Tired of hearing generalities and basically making it sound simply as this is just the way it is. Went to hospital. This is 3rd month of pain. The neck issue is gone. But the pain I have is still this intense, non-stop throbbing, pulsing pain that feels like it's in my bones. It's not superficial. Whether I am laying down, sitting, standing, doing something or nothing at all, the throbbing pain is there 24/7. There are certain extremes of bending my arm in certain positions which does cause more pain, but honestly, as I've told every doctor, if I know that doing X hurts, at his point I am ok to just not do X. But the 24/7 from waking until sleeping constant, non-stop throbbing pain has consumed my thoughts, life and any ability to be happy for 1 minute. I was going to the hospital once a month for 7 months. The took X-rays and scans of various types. They said I have calcium deposits on both shoulders - left and right. And that THIS was the new cause of the pain I have. First doctor I saw at hospital gave the impression the calcium deposits will never go away so I'll always have this pain. Second doctor I saw there (filling in for first doctor) said they will go away with time, thus the pain will go away, too. Taking meds to help reduce them, for pain (just ibuprofen) and one other med to help build up something in the area to help. Pain kinda came and went. Finally he referred me to a physical therapist. But since leaving the hospital visits a few months ago, and going to physical therapy, the pain is back stronger than ever. Pulsing pain only in the right arm - shoulder to elbow. Physical therapy doesn't work at all. And their thinking there is the calcium deposits have no role in this pain, but that it's because of posture? Scratching my head over this comment. Doctor there finally gave me Tramcet, which helped for the first 1-2 weeks, but now that doesn't do anything at all. And now here I am. It's been 11 months since the start of this. I've been to 1 clinic, 1 hospital and 1 physical therapy place. 3-5 doctors in total. 5 different stories from each doctor. And the pain is worse then ever. I am at a total loss as to what to do. It's unbearable. This pain is my life. Sure I can go to work, go out, and do whatever I want. But the pain is always there. It's with me right now as I write this, and it makes me want to cry, get angry, yell at these doctors who insist I keep coming back and smiling as they give me ibuprofen as pain relief which has zero effect. When I mention if it's something requiring surgery or injections (when they told me about the calcium deposits), their reaction was like not even comprehending how surgery would be necessary.","Chronic Pain , Neck Pain , Physical Therapy , Back Pain"

I have been resting my arm very well, but the injury is just so easily aggravated. If I press on on the part of the joint that hurts (superior) it almost feels like a lump moves. Any tips would be very appreciated!",

When seeing a doctor I was diagnosed with bronchitis and was told this was a symptom of poor health. About 2 years later I had a similar experience but this time I lost consciousness for 1-2 minutes. The doctor told me it was due to a sinus infection and again, poor health. Throughout my teens and early to mid twenties I had these fainting spells periodically and would wake up feeling tired and sweaty but also with a huge sense of relief. The attacks mostly took place in social settings and all of them started with a feeling of dread or worry. About 4 months ago I experienced what I understand to be a series of panic attacks and have since been dealing with GAD and a recent diagnosis of Bi-polar disorder. What I noticed is that the panic attacks started with the same feeling of worry and dread that my fainting spells started with but with no loss of consciousness.

My muscles always feel tight to the point where taking a full breath is difficult. I haven't been diagnosed with an Anxiety disorder, but I'm pretty sure I have one. I am a nervous wreck around strangers and I worry endlessly about my health and the future. In fact, I can't recall a time when I actually felt relaxed and worry/stress-free. Needless to say, I've had CT scans and blood work to rule of any medical condition which all came back normal. However, I recently started experiencing extreme muscle fatigue, feelings of exhaustion, weakness, I also get hot and an unsteady feeling as if I am swaying back and forth, almost like my legs are going to give in and I'm going to pass out. I had to leave work early today because my muscles felt so fatigued and I became really unbalanced. I'm pretty sure the increased anxiety from these symptoms didn't help at all. I have two more work days before I am off for 4 days which I am unsure how I am going to manage to get through as my job is pretty physically demanding. Lifting boxes for 5+ hours with a 15 minute break. I really want to quit as I dislike my job and i feel it is taking a complete toll on my body as well as my anxiety.  I also get muscle twitches once I sit down, or lay down and relax. Another thing, when I went to the doctor the first time, my blood sugar was like a 62 or 64. I haven't eaten or drank anything since 7-8pm the previous day and feared that maybe I had diabetes or hypoglycemia. When I went back, my blood sugar was 97, I ate breakfast and drank before going to the doc. My doctor doesn't see any sign of Diabetes or hypoglycemia but I'm not convinced. Maybe it;s just my anxiety trying to find another explanation for why I am feeling this way.  What can I do for muscle fatigue/weakness and this off-balanced feeling (feeling faint or like I am on a boat)? I really need some relief as it is really affecting my life and work.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression"

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/4184/there-s-something-wrong-with-my-roommate,There's something wrong with my roommate,"I live with my boyfriend and his roommate. Around August my roommate my roommate was having a really hard time with his depression. He was sleeping on the couch instead of in his own room and he stopped going to work or hanging out with friends. We were really concerned about him. About the end of November his half brother moved in for a few weeks. They started hanging out all the time and going out places and to parties. So we thought maybe he was feeling better...  But then things started getting really weird. One day I came home from work and he started saying all these weird spiritual things. Telling me I needed to protect myself my mind and my spirit. Telling me he had seen things. Then he told me that the previous night, he had channeled an angel. He's a religious person. But the was he was talking was not like him at all. Over the next couple of weeks he got stranger. He would be talking with us and then mid sentence just stop and stare. And he wouldn't remember anything about what we were talking about. He kept randomly saying weird things like ""Do you know?"" And we'd ask what. He'd just smile and say we weren't ready. Or that he knew we did know. I'd walk in and he'd just be standing and looking at nothing. And then talk nonsense again.  Then one night he wanted to talk to me. So I sat down with him to talk and he kept getting distracted and stalling. Finally I got him to settle down and get comfortable. The next hour I experienced a conversation with two distinct versions of him. One (it seemed more like the real him) would cry and say things like ""Help me I'm so scared!"" ""I don't know what to do. What do I do?"" ""I hate the way I am. This isn't me"" The other version was saying really bizarre things. Asking me how long I'd been in this world. Then asking ""Are you my mom?"" I'd reply no. ""Are you my sister?"" ""Are you my daughter?"" ""Well then are you me?"" He kept finding all these ""deeper"" meanings to things and talking about all these spiritual things. It was very unsettling. I could tell which one was which. His whole face would change.  The next day my boyfriend, a friend and I all sat down and talked to him. For four hours we talked to him about what had been going on in his life. He told us he'd been blacking out. Getting lost while driving and asking people on the side of the road how to get home. He told us he'd had a vision the world was going to end on Christmas Day. Slowly we started to uncover childhood trauma. The closer we got to it the more prominent and nonsensical the other version of himself was. At one point he just stared at me and said ""Should I listen to him?"" We asked him who. He wouldn't tell us at first but then he told us someone right at that moment was telling him he was sick in his heart. After we finally brought out the repressed memories from his childhood he seemed so relieved.  He seems to be okay currently. But we are very concerned. I know he was seeing a therapist but he won't go anymore. He has anti depressants but he had stopped taking them at the time and isn't taking them now. And I know he was smoking a lot of marijuana at the time. We've done a lot of research but we don't know if it could be Multiple Personality Disorder, Schizophrenia, Manic Depression.....we have no clue. We also don't know how to get him help. Or if its dangerous to have him living with us. He's 22. We don't know his parents and don't have a way to get in contact with them.  Even though he seems to be normal. I know there's something wrong and that as soon as his depression gets bad again or he's under high stress these symptoms will manifest.

I've been blessed as a beautiful, professionally successful woman with a graduate degree from a world's no.1 university. But now I quit my well-paid job and staying at home watching cheesy movies for 10 months despite being buried in college loan. It is hard for me to go out and meet people since I am in fear of social judgement. I came from a poor background so I have to work a lot to support myself and my family and my degrees. But when I got accepted to a top university, my female friends criticized me for not supporting my family but paying for my degree instead. (I bought a house for my family and supporting them from food to vehicles). But my close friends said I am a bad person who is not treating my family well because I did not pay for a more expensive wedding of my brother. (I was studying and in debt with my college degree and I could not even afford enough food for myself at that time. So I paid for my brother's wedding from my part-time job and could not afford to have the wedding in a good hotel as my friends said it should). What they said hurt me to the point that I decided to cut off ties with them. The problem is they told other friends about that and it started spreading to my professional circle.   It was not better at university. The university I went to is a top university dominated with rich people. I found some of my classmates could not bear with the fact that I was from a much more underprivileged background but still perform well in class. So when they found out that I was in a financial situation (I did not have a grant for second year), they said I am a liar. (They did not believe I came from an underprivileged background). It was to the point that I decided not to attend any class event anymore.( Another Asian classmate made the same decision so we hang out together instead).  I was very disappointed because I expect a very happy time with peers.  Now my family is supporting me. They no longer demand me for my financial support. Few months ago, my mother told me my sister in law did not like me to stay with them in my house. (I bought a house and brought my mother and my brother's family to live with since they don't have enough income). So I rented a place to live alone until I ran out of money and came back. The problem was my mother thought my brother would support her since he is a son, so she was very insecure that the house belong to me. I gave my house to my brother to secure her (long story. They are not bad people at all. They just don't know what to do in a city since we are immigrants from a remote area). By the way, I know my family may run out of patience if I keep continue not to work and not to have income. But I am still in a lot of pain, and fear, to meet people and to start working.

Talk about your day; take the time for a cozy chat. • Play for an hour with your kids every day after dinner. Give them an hour of your exclusive attention and recharge your battery that way. • Go for a walk outside during lunch or after work. • Take preferably two days every week to really relax like over the weekend for instance. • Paint an occasional big cross in your calendar.

So I took to the streets where I found what I needed but at a very hefty price . Also it made me feel like a drug addict . But it also took away the horrible pain I was feeling all over my Body and helped me have some kind of a normal Life , After working a 9 Hour day on my feet I just didn't want to walk another step . I would drive home and before I would even pull into driveway I Would start crying because I knew I was going have to stand up and walk and the pain was unbearable I would open the car door stand there holding onto door crying and saying it's only 30 steps to. The bed and that's where I would spend the rest of my night till I had to get up for   work the next day . If my son did not make me something to eat I just didn't eat , to much pain to Get out of bed to feed myself . One good thing is I lost 15 pounds over 5 months .so anyway I am still on pain medication from my friends. Not Cheap . I  Don't go to a dark alley or street corner or go into a a home where there are guns being pointed at me and pit bulls guarding the front door as my co-worker has this picture in her mind . That's where she thinks I buy from . She watches to many music videos or crime shows .  I go to work and some times I even cook dinner and do things around my home . I have somewhat of a normal life now but if I don't have the medication forget it I would not be able to work. It's a catch 22 sistuaton . I need to work to pay for my pills and I need pain pills to work so now if I could just get my Co-worker to understand all of this my time at my work place would be easier to show up to . I was just recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia and was given cymbalta . Don't feel any difference .  My co-worker tells me she is in pain to, which I totally belive ,but she is not doing anything about her pain she complains about her neck ,back and knees . I have recommended that she see a chiropractor or do physical therapy. Because she will not take pain medication she thinks that I should not and that my pain can't be all that bad or I would be out of work. She has no ideal how hard it is to get permanent disability. I also think that I need work just less time because I don't want to become useless or a shut in . Because of the pain I also have depression and no outside contact would be the worse thing for me .  So in closing if you have a co-worker who has confided in you please don't dismiss them or pick on them , show a little compassion and maybe it could help them to feel better . Don't talk about people behind thier backs either because they will find out and it only hurts both of the parties involved and sometimes all your other co- workers . Don't let anyone take away who you are !! Be proud of yourself ! Do not be taken advantage of !!  BE WHO YOU ARE AND WANT TO BECOME !!! Be strong !!!","Chronic Pain , Medication"

We want to hear from you: Have you or a family member ever been touched by an alcohol addiction?  There’s a strong link between serious alcohol use and depression. The question is, does regular drinking lead to depression, or are depressed people more likely to drink too much? Both are possible.

I am a 40 year old male in good overall health with no dietary or food allergy issues. About 8 mos. ago I had to stop drinking alcohol because of a stomach ulcer, which has since healed. My doctor gave me the go-ahead to consume alcohol again occasionally. For ~20 years prior to that I regularly consumed alcohol. I have always had a very high alcohol tolerance, never had any issues with feeling ill while drinking, and very rarely would have a hangover.  A few weeks ago I had one glass of wine with dinner (the first alcoholic beverage since I had stopped), and very shortly thereafter developed a massive headache and extreme nausea. I had to go to bed early, did not sleep well, and felt really off the next day. I did not connect this with the wine at the time; I thought I was just under the weather. A few days ago I had an after dinner drink. This was the only other drink I had had since before my ulcer. Within a short period of time I felt very tipsy (I have never felt anything following one drink in my whole life), which was followed by a skull crushing headache, extreme nausea and heartburn, and a fairly bad hangover the next day. I only had that one drink, and it was on a full stomach. This is really worrying me for health reasons; I am fine with the prospect of never having an alcoholic beverage again if I am going to have these reactions from now on. Is developing an alcohol intolerance (for lack of a better word) common, or is this something I should be concerned about and consult a physician?",Substance Abuse

I don't feel anything when I get poor grades and I don't get satisfaction from completing things I like. Its like my reward centers aren't working at all but I can still feel happy (or come across happy) most of the time. Every time I think of bringing it up with my parents (who Im comfortable talking to) and start thinking of how Im going to explain what I'm feeling, I suddenly feel better and think Im overreacting and just being a bad student.

Just when I thought I had a handle on my depression and anxiety via meds and therapy, my insurance co gets changed to one that my Psych nor therapist accept. Both are too expensive to pay out of pocket so it's back to the drawing board to find a new doc and therapist on the new insurance plan. Fun, seeing as how it took me a long time to actually feel comfortable with the ones I had. Needless to say, it's been a few months since I've rec'd any mental health care. It's really starting to get to me and I can clearly see and feel myself slowly slipping down that rabbit hole.

No, actually I have trust issues with pretty much everyone in my life.    I think the current issue I'm having, besides the whole no doc, no therapist, slowly running out of all meds thing is I'm feel like people I'm around daily are thinking the worst of me. Sometimes I'm consumed with worry about it. I think and worry about it so much that I'm sure it changes the way I interact with them.

I could not get out of bed. Six months later my elderly Father-in-law passed away and in the next year my cousins six year old Daughter died, my 56 year old cousin passed away and my close Friend who just turned 40 also passed away of a brain tumor. For 1 1/2 years I could not catch my breath! If I was not at work you could find me curled up in the fetal position in my bed. In the beginning my Husband was supportive however as time went by he told me to ""Get a grip and get over it as he had done with his Father's death!"" Our circumstances were entirely different in as he said ""Getting over it"" support wise. He was the baby of the family and still had his Mother who favored him and was well taken care of along with his Father by both of us over the first 18 years of our marriage. I on the other hand had very little support due to the fact that my Father was verbally, mentally and physically abusive to myself and my Mother and still trying to control me as an adult. My only sibling who was 7 years older than I obviously inherited my Father's traits since she tried to smother me to death in my crib, throw me down a well, locked me in the cellar of our house with no lights on every time she was supposed to babysit me, gave me black eyes and split lips, etc, etc. The more my Husband aggressively pushed me to have sex at his whim, go out, do the ""Norm"" the more depressed I became. Then the accusations came from him that if I no longer was interested in having sex when he wanted it I must be cheating on him. OMG! Was he kidding me? Nope. Turns out he was the one cheating. So finally a Doctor friend of mine sent me to a Psychiatrist friend of hers when I could no longer get out of bed, go to work, stop shaking, stop crying and had the look of death in my eyes. I can't say I remember anything from my first several appointments except being curled up in the fetal position in a chair in the Psychiatrists office. But within a couple of weeks I felt like a totally different woman. The medication started to kick in and the shaking, excessive crying, out of control racing thoughts all slowly came into control little by little. Not once did she say to me: ""And how does that make you feel?"" I've told her many times over the years that is the stupidest question Psychiatrists ask and had she said that to me I would have walked out. She chuckles. My Psychiatrist lets me know that she is amazed at the ""Strength and Power I have within me to make it to my 40's before having a break down with all the abuse I suffered from birth."" She is my ""Safe Place"" and has helped me through a messy divorce, helped me deal with all the abuse from my Father and Sister and supported me in my decision to permanently walk away from both of them for the betterment of my mental health. I have to say my life has been much more peaceful since that decision. But, it was not a decision I made lightly or quickly or that would be right for everyone. It has been 11 years that I have been seeing my amazing Psychiatrist and taking Seroquel and I can't tell you what a difference she and the medication have made in my life. I had held everything in for 40 some years but there came a breaking point. I'm so grateful for the professional help I received when that breaking point came. I am 58 years old now living a fantastic single life by my own choice, travelling to Africa by myself for a month at a time with no fear what so ever and coming home feeling like I have just lived the dream.

Am having a difficult time finding a pain management doctor who can deal with the pump and possibly take it out.  Any ideas? Thanks.","Chronic Pain , Back Pain"

The calf muscle that is bigger has spider veins and deeper dark blue veins in it. It also has stretch marks from growing bigger than it should have. I would like to find out if this has contributed to my bulging disc issue/pain or vice versa. Could it have been created on it's own with no explanation. Could it be a congenital birth defect? Would this be something that I would see a neurologist about? I have already been to an orthopedic doctor and chiropractor. I never had an injury that would have caused this.,

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/7641/unexplained-shoulder-pain,Unexplained Shoulder Pain,"For over a month I have been suffering from shoulder pain that radiates into my arm and hand on my left side. My hand feels numb and it hurts to use my arm. I went to the doctor about a week after the pain started. She thought I had strained my shoulder and organised some physio for me and some pain relief. My doctor said she could give me some time off work but I felt I was still able to work as I am right-handed and I can hold my left arm in front of me. She advised against the use of a sling as its best to keep using your arm to keep it moving. I was able to work for the first couple of weeks but then the pain became unbearable and I was unable to move my arm from resting in front of me. I had to get my Mum to take me to the doctor because i could not drive. They gave me a cortisone injection to relieve the pain and 5 days off work. The injection did not relieve my pain at all but it did give me some more movement back to how it was before the injection. During this time I have had difficulty doing everyday tasks. I can't do dishs, any kind of housework, wash my hair (I have very long hair), tie my hair up, hang washing out, put on a bra (even in the front and turn it around) or undo my bra. I have had my partner who lives with me to help with my bra and other household tasks. After the 5 days were up I couldnt go back to work I could barely move my arm again. I work as a support worker for an aged care community organisation caring for the elderly doing personal care and house work. There are no light duties involved in my work and I very much need my left arm to do my job. I went back to my doctor and she put me off for 3 weeks, gave me a codeine prescription and referred me to an orthopaedic surgeon at Grace Hospital. I rang to make an appointment and I was told they send it in the mail. I have had an ultrasound on my shoulder that came back clear. I have had an x-ray on my neck and shoulder that also came back clear. I have had blood tests to rule out infection and they have also came back clear. Yet the pain is still there. I have had physio but I don't think that is helping due to the cause being unknown. I have good days and bad days. Yesterday was an extremely bad day. I woke up barely being able to move my arm. I rang my doctor that morning as it was very painful and I didn't know when I would get the letter from Grace Hospital. She told me to go to the Tauranga Hospital immediately as she was concerned that it wasn't improving and it had been going on too long. She had rung ahead to the orthopaedics department so they knew I was coming. Thankfully when I got there I didn't have to wait long. I was seen by the orthopaedic registrar. He ordered more blood tests and an x-ray. He moved my arm around to test how the shoulder was. It appeared to be working normally and he couldnt work out where my pain was coming from. Although he did think it was possibly a pinched nerve which i thought it could be from Dr Google. Both tests came back clear. I was then seen by the orthopaedic consultant. He also moved my arm around to test the shoulder. He said he could not work out where my pain was coming from either. He is going to send me off for a M.R.I in a couple of weeks. He thinks I did not need to be in hospital and off he went. I was in so much pain and felt distressed after he left. I felt like I was no closer to finding out what was causing my pain. Now im just waiting for my M.R.I. I can't understand why they couldn't give it to me while I was there. I understand its a public system but i just dont think he took my pain seriously as he also said it would probably just go away on its own. In the mean time my relationship is under immense pressure. I suffer from Bipolar Disorder and am at risk of having a relapse. Being away from work for so long about 10 days so far is no good for my mental health. I dont have a reason to get up in the morning and I don't have contact with my clients. I feel very isolated and lonely.","Chronic Pain , Neck Pain"

My mom told me that it might be because I had no control over that ride and that triggered anxiety. I'm not sure though.

When I was in middle school (around age 12 almost 13) while trying to do a handstand for PE, I landed badly on my face (lol) and chest and some of my stomach area, and I fell sort of like a...scorpion landing, where my legs were in the air and curved toward my head. Basically I landed pretty badly and my body was curved awkwardly, and it was very hard to move afterwards. But I didn't want to tell my mom about it (she had breast cancer and i didn't want to be a burden) so I acted like everything was fine. I felt pain in my lower spine/back and the area around the lower spine was bruised and felt swollen. I guess I pulled something, fractured something, strained something, etc. I just tried to stay away from sports for a few weeks while still going to school and doing everything I can in PE class. After a few weeks it wasn't hurting as much anymore. When I pressed down on it, it still felt kind of bruised. I had a growth spurt when I was 11 -12, where I grew around 4.5 inches. After this injury, I grew two more inches from, I think, age 13-15/16. But I grew so slowly. VERY slowly. My older sister was around the same height as me at that age I got the injury, but after my injury, I started growing slowly. She, however, kept growing at a much faster rate, and is now two inches taller than me. I got this injury in 7th grade and only grew half an inch in 8th grade I think. She grew like two inches in 8th grade. She never had an injury. When I was little, everyone in my family thought I was going to grow taller than her. I also have longer feet than her. I was lactose intolerant as a child, though. But now I'm worried I stunted my growth from the injury. I did track and field when I was 11 - 12 years old. I stayed athletic in middle school. In high school, I did track and cross country. I was a very fast runner and was in the varsity team. However, since that injury, I noticed that my lower spine area felt more ... flexible? and whenever I stretch it, I hear and feel this spongy sound/feeling. I also feel like my posture is bad ever since. It also hurts to sit for a certain period of time. Anyways, my mom is 5'5'', dad is 5'9'', older sister is 5'6''. My sister grew a lot even after her growth spurt :( I'm worried that I stunted my growth from this injury. I'm also worried about my lower back because it bothered me on and off ever since. I did a lot of research about spinal injuries and disc herniation in growing preteens but all I find are articles I can't really read. My lower back does bother me occasionally but I don't know if it's all in my mind, since I left the injury untreated. Sorry for long read. Also.. would a specialist be able to tell me much in relation to stunted growth if I get it checked now? And if I actually did injure it pretty bad, would they be able to help much?

Sleep,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sleep/3892/perfect-storm,Perfect Storm,"I'm post menopausal and have been for some time and in my late 50s. About 3 years ago I had an episode when drifting off to sleep for a nap where I felt like I was being thrown out of the bed. I passed it off as a fluke. However, since then I developed difficulty falling asleep and when I do getting up every two hours. I am someone who used to sleep like a rock. I also got dx with bruxism at my dentist's office. In addition, during wakefulness if I am going over a bridge or high overpass, I get the same feeling as being thrown out of bed but feel like the car is going to go over the bridge and always to the right. This causes a tremendous amount of anxiety and fear. I am normally a very calm person and don't feel depressed. I was very active and never had fears of overpasses, didn't like bridges but managed them without these experiences. Never had fears of driving. All of these things seem to be connected. I drank wine to get to sleep initially but felt tired the next day and then asked my PCP for a sleeping pill and got Ambien. I hate taking medications or alcohol for sleep. Can anyone shed some light on this. Thank you",

I would limit myself to only doing it once a week until I was about 17 with a few months until my 18th birthday. Around that time I started smoking daily. It wasn't until I started using daily, that I noticed I didn't feel right. I can remember the day when I came into school (high school) and almost felt like I was high..even though I wasn't. I should have stopped right then and there, but I didn't. I continued smoking at least once a day for almost the next 4 years and have recently stopped. Throughout those 4 years I took small breaks varying from about a few days to a couple of weeks, however I never felt as if I was recovering. In my mind, I figured that If I wasn't feeling different after a short break..then what's the point of stopping. Smoking also effected my appetite in the sense that I couldn't eat unless I smoked prior. Anyways, I'm now 21 years old, almost 22.. and haven't used in about a month now. I will say that my short term memory feels like it has partially come back..but I still feel cloudy. It almost feels like my brain is fighting to get back to the way it was. I know that time, exercise, and probably nutrition are the best healers for the brain. I'm just worried that my brain was still developing important connections when I started chronic use, and that there may be permanent damage. It would be so difficult to live with the fact that I permanently damaged my brain due to personal choice..especially when I had such a good memory. I guess I'm just looking for professional feedback or personal experiences to answer my question: Am I ever going to feel normal again?",Substance Abuse

I don't want to scare you, but there is a forest just up ahead. One so dense and dark, the sunlight won't reach you for awhile. You will wander lost, in this long, perilous night, not knowing if it will ever come to an end. But believe me, the light will find you again, and when it does, you will no longer be afraid of the dark.  Stop to catch your breath. Soon, a jagged mountain of ice will rise before you, so steep it will make you want to turn back around. Don't despair; the first foothold is always the most difficult and every inch you claim of that cold, hard precipice will only make you stronger. Before you know it, the ground will level out beneath you, and you will look back to see you had conquered what you once thought impossible.  See that turn just up ahead? That's the place where love will meet you, with arms so warm it will melt away the winter in an instant. And then, it will be summer for a very long time.

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/5543/mental-illness-violence,Mental Illness & Violence,"I lived near Chicago for many years as my stepfather's family had a history of addiction & with my bipolar it made it worse as males were becoming violent toward women. Not wanting the illicit drugs & active alcoholism around was the biggest reason knowing it would become dangerous for me to live around the amount of addiction that I did. Addiction, Mental Illness & Violence are a deadly combination no matter what as it affects & destroys families in many ways as that's why I use to consider people with addiction dead to me. A Chicago reporter Walter Jacobson was a big reason why I don't give anyone money to support their addiction knowing tremendous contributions to addiction in general were keeping people in their addiction of choice.  Looking to kill anyone who was violent toward women was big for me as no one deserves violence especially after what happened to Christy Mack as victims of domestic violence need to step up & be heard no matter what as this isn't a victim less disease. I suffer from bipolar disorder but realize this could become PTSD(Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) as well knowing I was around amounts of addiction but am glad that I didn't fall into the traps that most mentally ill people do becoming SMI (Severely Mentally Ill).   Having been around 12-Step programs for almost 2 decades this has been something I learned slowly & over time as getting in to a family program that deals with addiction will help re: Nar-Anon, Al-Anon. I will admit that walking into a meeting for the 1st time is never easy but know that it'll be a relief when it happens.","Abuse Victims , Depression , Bipolar Disorder"

I grew up in a very abusive and horrible environment with no supervision no parents around and nobody to protect me. Im writing this because i know how many people are out there suffering right now. whether your addicted to pills or dope or just sex. or Maybe all 3 and then some. Let me tell you about me i have suffered abuse for decades that is hard for most people to fathom. I started doing drugs at a very young age and by the time i was 17 i was addicted to extacy and oxycontin. I kept it hidden from almost everyone because the moment i started to take them my brain finally shut down and my problems went away. This became my coping mechanism for many years and in addition, I have overdosed so many times i should be dead a 100 times over. I got tired of being another statistic and i figured out a whole new way to deal with life a much better one and im happy for the first time in 30 years when i was a baby. I did every opiete that existed and eventually went to heroin in 2010. it took a few more wake up calls before i finally got gods message to me. God basically told me stop trying to kill yourself you have a big purpose and to trust the universe. That is something thats hard for me. However, I figured out how to beat everything and finally live a normal life. I have been living the best part of my life ever in the last 3 years. 3 years ago i quit smoking cigerettes and methadone at the same time along with xanax and all kinds of other medications and drugs. I took the drugs to mask my pain and feelings from childhood and when i was young adult, Furthermore, I really hit rock bottom 3 years ago I was trying to die and i wanted to yet part of me still wanted to live. I have knowledge now through a program i developed on my own without anybody's help on how to get off drugs how to change everything around and actually be happy. Is it easy? Hell no but after several months and a couple years of fighting myself and everything else nonstop i finally realized that i was waisting my life and my potential and i have unlimited potentional i guess that happens when you have an IQ in the 160s. The way hospitals in this country and any other know nothing about treating people that are mentally ILL they know nothing about substance abuse and thats all it is substance abuse. That bs about it being a disease in my oppinion its a cop out so that person can use it to try and forgive themselves but it wont work it never does. Eventually even after 5, 10,20 and even 30 years of sobriety they still relapsed. Doing drugs and letting yourself get addicted to them is a choice. not a disease. If i could get my message out there i can help so many of you. If the rehabs and hospitals had my knowledge and adopted the protocols that 92% failure statistic would easily drop down below 10%. I have kicked everything you can think and yes i even kicked methadone a bunch of times cold turkey it was insanity. It takes work but if your willing to try my program works. Im not trying to make any money or sell my knowledge or services for any reason other then to help those who suffer. My name is Jimmy and 3 years ago i was in the hospital with kidney failure i was basically dead my entire body shut down. My right arm suffered severe nerve damage on all 3 nerves that run through your hands and up your arms and into your neck. I was told i would never write again and that i would not fully recover. I decided no this is not going to be my life i used my anger and rage to get back in college and to exercise at the gym all the time. For those of you reading this wondering whos this guy? he doesnt know how i suffer and your all wrong. I went through it for 21 years my parents were told by drs i was too far gone and that it was hopeless. 3 years later ive never been better and i fixed my credit i earned myself a better life and you can to. The first thing is stop thinking the world owes us anything or people because nobody owes us a single thing. We owe it to ourselves. This is not a sales pitch and im not asking for money i only want to help and i know i can. The rehabs and mental hospitals arnt structured to help people they are structured to keep them sick. I know this because it was me and then i went against medical advice because i couldnt take it anymore. I have alot more to say and im even writing a book about addiction & mental illness ill post on here when i release it which wont be for a long time. IF YOUR STILL READING THIS HAVENT YOU HAD ENOUGH? HAVENT YOU SUFFERED ENOUGH? AND YES NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK YOU DO DESERVE TO HAVE A HAPPY LIFE. Remember one thing you have to want it bad enough, but i promise you this you will get better and you can do thosethings that u think are impossible. Im here for anyone that has a problem in life or mental illness or drugs. I do not judge but i can help. Dont be afraid if your still reading this then you want the help and ill talk toyou soon",

Firstly, a bit of background information. I am a 22 year old male working as a bartender in a nightclub. I have been suffering with bad anxiety from the age of 15 or 16, progressively getting worse as the years went on. In the past few years it has been extremely bad due to lots of reasons, the main one being the drama behind my parents break-up which was about 2 - 3 years ago (but the fighting started about 8 years ago). I'll spare all the little details, lets just say I have been through a lot of stress, being the peace keeper day after day with a constantly fighting family. I now just live with my mother and brother. Things can still be pretty bad at home. I am generally quiet and calm during all fights and I always try figure out who is right and who is wrong (if I am wrong I will admit straight away), but when shouting (and i mean constant shouting) arguments go on for over an hour with nobody else even trying to understand anyone elses side of the argument , I reach boiling point and lose my mind and go completely mental. I used to be able to keep my cool, but after going through this literally every day for years on end, I now start smashing, cursing at the top of my lungs, and punching everything (including myself) for about 10 - 20 seconds, like a mad man. Once I calm down after those few seconds I do be in total shock, feeling nearly as if someone else had gone crazy and not me. I do be nearly uncontrollable, so much built up rage comes out of me that I fear for my own safety and others around me. I have gone for councelling and I am on anti-depressants for my anxiety but neither worked that well. I (stupidly) turned to drink for a few years too, but I have recently stopped. Anyways, I suffer with a lot of unusual body aches and pains. Previously I have gone to the doctor about abdominal pains and chest pains, which I was very worried about as I googled my symptoms and most websites said I had cancer or some other terrible illnesses. The doctors put them down to Anxiety and that's when they sent me for councelling. I am finished my councelling a few months now and I have recently decided to come off my anti-depressants (I only have about 2 weeks of tablets left until I will be off them completely) as the side effects are also ruining my day to day life. I constantly feel tired and have no energy, I also don't feel much emotion anymore. Most days i feel like i'm in a dream, walking around as if nothing is real. My memory is absolutely terrible, and everybody notices it too (not that them noticing bothers me) but not being able to remember what I've done in my own life is horrible. I don't feel excited for much, I just worry more about my health problems, constantly. I wake up worrying and fall asleep worrying. I have had (and am currently having) health scares. Some consist of finding hard lumps on my testicles - the lumps sometimes dissapear so the doctors told me they are fine, i have also found unusual lumps on different parts of my body, etc etc. But the doctors told me they are all nothing to worry about, but unfortunately I still worry. I also used to get all these really random uncomfortable pains in my abdominal area and chest. They would never stay in one place for more than a few hours though, it was like the pains moved to another area in their own free will. I went to the doctor and they told me it was because of my anxiety. I think they were right because the pains went after a few days of knowing there was nothing wrong with me. Now, however, I am in a similar situation again. I just got back from the doctors the other day after going complaining about more aches and stomach problems. Basically I went in and told the doctor that my stomach is bloated and is sore, mostly in the right hand side under my right ribcage. There is a dull ache there and sometimes it feels hard inside, but sometimes it softens again. Every now and then my chest gets this tight feeling, and then it feels like some breath has been sucked out of me. Sometimes i get stabbing pains in my chest and what feels like my heart too. She had a look at my file and said that when i got my tests done last year that I was low in folic acids. She then just prescribed me tablets for that and also vitamin D tablets, and put my pains down to anxiety again. Normally once I find out this news then the pains go, but they don't seem to be going this time. Although, the pain isn't so much on the right side now, but more in the middle where my solar plexus is. My stomach can sometimes be sensitive to the touch too. I forgot to tell her that I am very gassy, flatulating a lot and excreting about 4 or 5 times a day (although I have always gone often enough per day, i have a very fast metabolism), it's just now when I need to go I feel like I wont be able to hold it for too long without it being really uncomfortable. I think I could have seen tiny specks of red in it, which worries me more. I also forgot to tell her that I amgetting bad acid reflux again (I told one of the other doctors before though so it's on my file), i feel like my chest and throat are burning a lot and yesterday after dinner i burped up this white foamy stuff. Even today I feel when I burp that a bit of food is going to come up. Actually when i just swallow my saliva I have this weird feeling in my throat like there's something there that needs to be swallowed, but it wont go down. And just there tonight in work I start getting a sore back (bottom right area) that made me feel a bit sick. I was doing a bit of heavy lifting today though, so it could be just from that? The worry is killing me, because no matter what is wrong with me I always think the worst. To make matters worse, we are broke and can't afford to pay for our house anymore so we have to sell it by January or we lose it. It's not making me too sad but it is just an addition to all of my stress, as I will be leaving my family home for good and moving to a different side of the country, leaving all my friends. So what I really want to know is can all these physical symptoms just be down to severe anxiety and stress? Or do you think I should go visit the doctor again? I am very sorry for the length of this, but any help and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression"

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/32628/headache-related,Headache Related,"I am a 47 year old male, have had migraines since I was about 8 years old. Always the same never any variation. I sharp stabbing pain through my left eye through my head and out the lower left part of my skull by the neck. Feels like a cold steel spike through my head.  I recently am getting these ""Things"" I don't know what they are. I have lesions on my brain though why is a matter of debate. They are either MS or migraine lesions. Two different neuros two different opinions. But now that aside I am getting these attacks that last 5 days. The first happened October the 8th. Now it starts out as brain pain, I know that brain does not actually feel pain but for lack of a better term that is what I call it. It is very electrical in nature occurring in my hairline and forehead region. It is bilateral not one sided at all and not on the sides. It starts out with pain at a 7. Then over the next 3 days it builds in intensity to a 10. At day 4 and 5 there are surges of pain that are so far off the pain scale that I am literally incapable of thought when they occur. On day 6 it is just completely gone.  Not only does it cause this electrical brain pain but the normal chronic pain I have also ramps up in intensity with it untill it also hits a 10. But it seems to only be the chronic pain along my spine that gets worse leaving my shoulder which has chronic pain alone. So then in November also on the 8th it starts up again. Knowing that I will not survive it a second time I go to the ER and I am admitted. I am given IV steroids at a high dose for MS. Day 2 a new neurologist enters the picture says that he thinks that it is a migraine, and now the steroids are tapered down and toradol is added. Something breaks it on day 3. It just ends and I go home. Now I had never stopped the steroids in the hospital because I was on so much they couldn't just stop. The reason the new neurologist did not think it was MS was because he had never heard of any one who had MS not showing that on a spinal tap. However The National MS Society has stated that some 5-10% of people with MS test negative.   (CSF)  So here is the thing with it being a migraine the pain was electrical not stabbing, I did not have any sort of ""Premonition"", no over sensitivity to light or sound, no vomiting, no after headache and I never passed out from pain. These are all things that occur with my migraines. And it does not seem to fit the definition of stress or cluster headaches. I am not arguing for it being an MS attack, in fact I definitely do not want it to be one. It also does not sound familiar to people with MS, so there is that.  I am waiting to find out how many months I will have to wait until I can see a new neurologist as when I called the Office that I want to go to they were telling me the end of February and I have to have my doctor set it up","Headaches , Migraines"

I'm now 28. I was always told by Doctors when I was younger that it was growing pains and then I was ignored. As I got older, my parents became more concerned. I Had xrays, blood tests, bone scans, etc around 17. nothing was found so it was pretty much given up on. I've just been dealing with the pain ever since. As time goes on it becomes harder to get out of bed sometimes. And harder to find motivation to push through. The pain can sometimes start as an ache, other times its a throb and even get sharp. It can happen in both legs from ankle to knee. sometimes I can even track the pain as it moves up and down my legs. I haven't been able to find any sort of consistency between activity and the pain. I can do 500 miles on the snowmobile in a weekend and be fine. Other times I just wake up in pain. Tylenol and Ibuprofen can sometimes take the edge off but that's about it. My last Dr. just offered me Vicodin and that's where it ended. I'm really looking for a new direction to head in to at least find a diagnosis if not a solution. I have a pretty high pain tolerance, mostly from dealing with this for years, and don't want to be dependent on pain killers to make it through my day. I also have knee issues and combined this can be crippling to me at times. I'm also having the knee issues addressed again and maybe there's a correlation between the two.

Now, I have a severe family history of diabetes on both sides of the family, with most family members already suffering against it and found several articles online mentioning a link between this drug and blood sugar levels. . When I asked my doctor, he said it is safe, most drugs are contraindicated to diabetes, and I should just go ahead and take it.  I guess I just wanted a second opinion on this?

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/32387/sprained-ankle,Sprained Ankle,"Back in September, I was walking on uneven ground and tripped. My left ankle twisted all the way backwards before I landed on it, making matters worse. It was excruciatingly painful and I spent about the next ten minutes flat on the ground before the pain just flat out disappeared. At first I thought that I'd just misinterpreted how bad I'd actually hurt it, so I got up and continued on my walk, which was a bad idea because after about thirty minutes, the pain kept slowly creeping back up. By the time I got home it was pretty badly swollen, but I thought I'd just wrap in in an ace bandage, ice it, and go to bed to see how it'd be in the morning. It was worse when I woke up. All movement in that foot was extremely painful and applying any pressure on it shot a pain that felt like someone was sticking red hot needles into my flesh all through the injured area. I didn't go to the doctor because everyone convinced me that it'd be fine after about a month. It didn't get much rest time because due to my day to day life, I have to walk around a lot and I don't have very understanding bosses. It's almost December of the same year now. The pain has gone down, but it hurts bad enough to cause me some concern. The swelling is gone most days unless I move around a significant amount and I have basic movement back in it. I've noticed a long bruise line that wraps around the front of my ankle where it's supposed to bend and when I try to completely straighten out my foot I can't, which I could before I'd hurt it. I keep it in a brace most of the time because without it, my foot just flops to the side like jello and won't stay up right when I'm lying down. I've also noticed a drastic decrease in my balance. I have to be careful while standing still or else I'll topple over. My balance is totally normal while moving, but I have difficulty staying standing at all. I forgot to mention that about a week after the incident, my entire leg had gone completely numb and dead and when I tried walking on it, it completely gave out and twisted backwards in the other direction. Not sure if that's all that important regarding my situation, but thought I'd better mention it. I know it's not broken because the pain doesn't appear to be in the actual bone (which I've broken my bones enough times to know what that feels like). The fact that it's not healed yet though is what really shocks me though because usually my body heals at a faster rate and this seems to be taking quite a long time. I just don't understand, so it'd be very helpful to me if someone knows why it is the way it is.",

If so, how have you dealt with it and what did your doctor do for you I've been on Duloxetine for almost 2 years, Cyclobenzaprine for over a year and Amerge for well over 15 years for my migraines. They all increase Serotonin and when taken together you get a major overload of Serotonin which results in Serotonin Syndrome. It causes terrible twitching/jerking of the body when you try to sleep. Cold sweats, shallow breathing, Agitation or restlessness, Rapid heart rate and high blood pressure, heaving sweating, Headache, Shivering, Goose bumps, High fever, Seizures, Irregular heartbeat, Unconsciousness. Severe serotonin syndrome can be life-threatening.  I went throught this last night, but was fortunate enough not to have ended up in the hospital. I didn't have the high fever, seizures, rapid heart rate, high blood preassure or become unconsciousness, but I had everything else. It was horrible and I'm still suffering from some of side effects of too much Serotonin. I read up on it and it said it can take as long as 48 hours or longer to get the extra Serotonin out of your body. The problem is, I have to take Duloxetine every morning for depression and I have to take Cyclobenzaprine for my severe muscle spams which occur almost daily. And recently my migraines have come back and I've had to start taking the Amerge to stop the migraines. Can anyone suggest something they are taking in place of Dulxetine that is working well for them, doesn't make you gain weight and doesn't give you so much excessive Serotonin.

In the past 4 - 5 years I have started having major germophobia and legal-phobia issues. My germophobia really started when I started my last job as a janitor. Cleaning the bathrooms started getting to me. I can't touch door knobs for fear of spreading germs from myself to the knob and thereby to someone else. I'm using lysol wipes to wipe the toilet every time I pee and see any splash on the toilet because I'm afraid of spreading CMV. If I use hand sanitizer I spend time asking myself should I reach for my debit card when going somewhere or do I need to wash my hands first. If I touch the debit card with sanitizer on my hands, I'm asking myself....""did I intentionally and with malice give the card to the cashier with intent to harm"" basically interrogating myself to rule out that I have or have not committed a crime.  My ""legal-phobia"" as I call it, has to do with my being afraid of breaking laws. This started about 5 years ago as well when I realized I may have unknowingly been involved in some legally questionable billing practices at a doctor's office I worked at and was afraid I was committing a sin against God if I committed anything higher than misdemeanor, which would require me to live in the shame of being a ""felon"". Ever since then, it's been downhill from there.  All this makes me frustrated. People treat me like I'm crazy when they see how much I wash my hands. Then in October 2015 I took my grandfather to get blood work who saw him didn't wash her hands between patients. What's worse is I allowed her to see my grandfather anyway knowing the risk that presented. Now I'm living in agony with the possibility I may have caused him some kind of harm. He's 93 and hasn't had any major issues lately but there's always this thought in the back of my mind that if he dies, it could be my fault.",Anxiety & Panic Disorders

The medication has been working well for him. He is seeing a pychiatrist monthly. We both go to a family counselor every other week and he sees his school counselor daily (usually just a few minutes in the morning and then a half hour session once a week). There are a couple of things I need advice on: 1. His dad. We've been divorced for 8 years now. We get along just fine and have no ill will towards eachother.  That said, he is my ex for a reason. Many reasons actually. But the one that stands out and continues to be a problem is his stubborn ignorance. Our son was diagnosed with ADHD at age 7. Ex fought with me on medication saying that ADHD doesn't exist. It's just the school wanting him to be a certain way. etc. I went ahead with medication against his wishes. He is no longer on ADHD meds for a variety of reasons, but I continued with behavioral therapy against ex's wishes too. When this depression diagnosis came up, my ex pretty much told our son to ""get over it"" and ""stop acting that way."" He tells him that it's his choice to be happy or not and that people will think he is ""crazy."" As a result, I have been reluctant to involve him in therapy with us. The psychiatrist really wants to meet him. She knows my feelings on this and I've presented my side of the story when it comes to his line of thinking. She understands, but still thinks she needs to involve him. My son is also reluctant to have his dad involved and didn't want me to involve him at all, but I felt an obligation to at least let him know our son was being treated and on medication. Any advice? I don't want to upset my son. I do know my ex's attitude towards these things is not good for him either. I also am 100% sure my ex's attitude will not change regardless of who talks to him about it. 2. My son was always a good student. He was always polite and well behaved. The biggest issues his teachers ever had was him talking out of turn. That was until this year. This year his grades plummeted. He's started speaking disrespectfully mostly to his teachers and my mom (my mom helps me a lot with taking my son to and from practices, piano lessons, etc).  He has a lot of friends. He was bullied and picked on a lot prior to 4th grade. In 4th grade he joined football and basketball and kind of found his niche of friends at that time. He is now one of the ""popular"" kids and everyone seems to like him according to the teachers and vice principal. He rarely has issues with his friends. He has also made some very poor decisions this school year - from peeing in the woods at recess (no idea why), to sending inappropriate pictures through school email, and constantly being disrespectful and defiant. These things that seemed to start all of the sudden this year lead us to the depression diagnosis. Since being on meds, his grades have improved. His behavior has improved, but is still not like he used to be - and he was on the verge of being expelled. We now have weekly check ins with the vice principal to discuss his behavior for the week and deal with any issues.  The other day I noticed that his arm had some weird pen marks on it. I asked what it was and he said ""Nothing."" At our Friday check in with the VP she said that one of his teachers told him he had done something incorrectly and asked him to redo his work. He proceeded to stab himself in the arm with the cap of his pen - it did not break the skin or anything. When I asked him about this he said he did it because he didn't know what his teacher wanted him to do and he was frustrated. This is not the first time he's taken frustration or anger out on himself physically. It doesn't seem to happen often, but it has happened a couple of times in the past at school. My ex actually said to him ""You're acting like a retarded idiot."" I will definitely be bringing this up with his psychiatrist. I guess as far as this part is concerned - I just don't know what to do! I am so worried about him. Life is hard enough and having to deal with clinical depression, ADHD, and now possibly self-harming...I just don't want him to struggle so much in life. So, what can I do? Do I involve my ex in all of this? How do I ""undo"" his awful name calling and the way he speaks to our son about these things? I know it doesn't help our son at all to hear his father saying these things and I'm sure him hearing ""Depression and ADHD don't exist"" and then being told he has it is confusing for him. I just wish I knew what to do.  As far as the depression, anxiety, ADHD, and now this self-harming stuff coming up, I feel I am doing the best I can to get the help he needs.

First it was GAD, then it became worse. I had my first hospitalization when I was 10 years old. I had stopped eating because kids at school called me ""fat"" and ""ugly"" every single day. My next hospitalization was at age 12 because I had an emotional breakdown(for reasons that I will get to in a little bit). I had a hospitalization at age 13, for the same reason. Last year (2016) I attempted suicide, and I finally told them what had happened to make such a happy little girl turn into such a ,as the doctors said, ""Depressed monster""...... It all started at age 10 when the kids started called me ""fat"" and ""ugly"". Then the became more violent, in their words and their actions. They would slam me against lockers, tell me to ""kill myself"", and texted me that they would ""find me and kill me"" (etc..). It got to the point that I would make myself throw up so I wouldn't have to go to school, especially because every time I asked a teacher they just told me to ""stay away from them"", or that ""they would take care of it"", but they never did anything! The thing that finally drove me of the ledge was when a teacher started in. Not in the same way the kids did,but she embarrassed me(as if I wasn't embarrassed enough),and pointed me out. And because of that I have a fear of getting called on, in class, and everywhere else(unless I am absolutely positive it is a good thing). So, I took 250 Ibuprofen (I threw 100 of them up) and 5 Tylenol, and the ONLY reason I am alive is because my stomach was pumped. One of the other bad experiences, was when they saw the cuts all up my legs and sides, then my my mother started to sob and that was worse then any of it, when my strong, courageous,loving mother, broke into tears. I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder(type2),GAD,MDD and phases of Bulimia and Anorexia. I just want anyone out there who feels like you want to die or be skinny etc.. I want you to know that you are the only one who is you and some day, you can make the world a better place(but only if your alive)","Depression , Eating Disorders , Self Harm , Bipolar Disorder"

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/2920/recent-depression-diagnosis,Recent Depression Diagnosis,"Recently I was diagnosed with severe depression. It came as a surprise to me but apparently other people could see the symptoms. I don't want to say that I am always sad or unhappy, but I haven't been feeling myself. At first I had just put that down to the constant pain that I was in. Daily tasks began to be too hard to do, it hurt to get out of bed, it even hurt to breathe. I had just thought that I was relapsing in my nervous system disease. From battling it for two years I had thought I would be able to distinguish the pain. Before the diagnosis I tried to deal with it on my own, I had decided that the best thing to do was stop my extra curricular activity and focus on getting the physical pain under control and just go back on the medication for the nerve pain. After being back on the medication for about two weeks I realized that is wasn't really helping, all it was doing was making me sleep more; and it wasn't like I needed the extra sleep. So I consulted my doctor again, and we tried a different medication. And once again it didn't work, I found my mood had been worsened. When the second attempt at medication didn't work my doctor had asked to speak to me alone; I had always brought my mom to appointments since I was always afraid of what the results would be. My family doctor did an evaluation and by the end of our conversation she had diagnosed me with severe depression and referred me to a psychiatrist.  I didn't take the news well; its not that I view people with depression differently it is just that I didn't see that in myself. I knew I had an anxiety disorder since I was diagnosed with that at the same time as the nerve disease but I didn't see the signs of depression. I cried once she told me, and I cried for about an hour, I didn't want anyone to look at me differently. I had and still do have this fear that once people know that they will talk to me differently, as it is I feel as though my mom is cautious about her wording and how she talks to me since the diagnosis.  I'm at a point where I don't want to see a psychiatrist and I don't know if it is that I am in denial or if its another reason. But the depression has started to get worse, it is effecting my school and social life. The physical pain of it is also getting worse and now I can't sleep. I just don't know what to do anymore. If you have any advise please reply; or if you have any experience with a psychiatrist and are willing to share please reply.

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/30464/false-negative-on-drug-panel,False negative on drug panel.,"I have been a chronic pain patient for over 10 years now. I have never ""lost, misplaced had the pharmacy short me, or accidently ruined"" my narcotic medication. A little over six months ago due to new state laws I had to leave the orthopedic who had been overseeing my pain managment for more than five years, and enter a pain management program with a pain clinic. After the first couple of visits we tweaked my medication, by lessening the strength of my morphine er by more than half, as well as switching from dilaudid to percocet for breakthrough pain and adding gabapentin. The percocet actually seemed to be doing a better job than the dilaudid and was begeninng to reduce the strength of it as well. Then the simple act of reaching for my daughter's cup on a table caused my back to ""lock up"". The new mri would confrim what I had been thinking for the previous 18 months my back was getting worse. Now I not only had the herniation of a disc that was botched on my original injury and surgery, I now had four more to go with it as well as other various problems that go along with this type of problem. My movement has become much more restricted and I do most of my walking with a walker. Because of this I switched from taking a urine test to a saliva test when going to my pain clinic. It was simply easier than trying to hold a cup , hold myself and balance myself. Herein lies the problem, three of my last five test have come up negative for the morphine er, but the percocet is positive. Here are some factors that may need to be considered. 1. It takes a lot of saliva to regesiter, and due to my muscle relaxer I have bad cotton mouth, so I would swirl water and chew gum right up to the point of placing swab in my mouth (as well as still having gum in mouth) 2. I do suffer from type 2 diabetes 3. While I take the percocet only about two hours before the test, it is almost time for me to take my morphine er when I take the test. While they have not taken any action yet I know it can't be too far away. Being new to the program I know I have not built up any trust yet so my ""word"" I'm sure carries very little weight. On my last visit I switched back to urine test in hopes this would solve my problem. Does anyone know why not only my morphine er would not show, but that the percocet would when the other shows to be absent.  Thank you for any and all help","Knee Pain , Migraines , Back Pain"

Before, I used to be the funny friend who was loud and interested in a conversion but now, instead of concentrating on what someone is saying, I'm trying to focus on what I'm going to say next or if the person is getting bored or when to keep/stop talking. I also pretend to laugh all the time when I'm with my friends and when I actually find something funny, I am the only one laughing. Its become so stressful that I avoid talking to my friends all together. I have declined so many plans to hang out with them and I never answer phone calls unless its important. I struggle to keep conversations going and I would much rather listen to my own thoughts. I hate small talk but I always run out of things to talk about. I do not have issues talking to my mother and father but I don't speak to my sister or brother at all anymore because I have nothing interesting to say so I completely ignore their existence. I can't ignore my friends because I will end up with no one to ""talk to"" and being alone actually makes me more prone to feeling upset.  I have also been getting weird thoughts which lack morals. I feel like I do have empathy which means I can see life from someones else's point of view but I don't feel sorry for anyone. I enjoy seeing other people envy me but I never boast or make someone feel small. Seeing myself more successful than anyone else makes me feel powerful and seeing a friend do better than me fuels me with anger I try to contain. I would say I'm a polite person and I ever insult anyone but I do have very horrible thoughts of what I would do to my enemies since I don't have the guts to stand up for myself.

I know I would never be the cause of someone else's death (unless it was an accident) but I constantly think about the power I have over other people.

I saw an orthopedic surgeon about my pain which only appeared when gripping large objects or lifting something with arms extended and palms down. He prescribed me an anti-inflammatory and 6 weeks of PT including dry needling. After 6 weeks of no improvement I received a steroid injection. The injection made me feel like new again and I returned to normal activity. This lasted almost 7 months. Now, the pain is back and much worse. I feel it in everything I do. It even hurts to touch. I was offered another steroid shot but turned it down because I feel like it is just a ""band-aid"" and I was worse off in the end. I was sent for an MRI and it showed some minor tears in the tendon and tendonitis. The doctor thought surgery was not necessary and prescribed another 6 weeks of dry needling and the anti inflammatory again. I'm happy that I do not need surgery but I am disgusted with the idea of repeating this failed treatment again. I'm not sure where to go from here? Any thoughts? I'm sick of dealing with this.

Before my unemployment I worked a parttime, quite physical job. Since my job ended I haven't been as active as before. I walk a lot with my dog, about an hour a day, but I've noticed that since my unemployment those walks have become a lot more taxing. I experience sometimes severe lower back pain and pain in my feet sometimes within minutes after leaving my house, and it makes walking a lot less enjoyable. I don't really have pain except for when I go for a walk, which seems backward to me--I'd sooner expect walking to help with back pain. I suspect the cause for my pain is the fact that my body's become used to a lot less physical activity compared to before I became unemployed, and so it struggles even with walks I've taken for the past five years. I am overweight, and because I can't take the pain anymore I'm trying to set up an exercise regime--walking and eventually hopefully running on the treadmill every other day and doing yoga on rest days. Will this help me overcome the pain? Is my decreased activity the cause or is something else going on?",Back Pain

I have severe gulf war illnesses and lost my colon with other internal body parts are rotting away. Back in 2000 I was given Prednisone approx. 1200mg/day for about six months. Due to this, I have developed Avascular Necrosis of my right hip. Latest bone density scan says that it is severe, but I already have been feeling this since on or about May, 2003. I was then put on morphine (the pills that disolved under the tongue), it made me really nauseated. As did long acting morphine and methadone. They, the VA, put me on Fentanyl and was on such a high dose that they could never transition me to another drug, not sure if a drug other than Fentanyl is available. I had Ulcerative Colitis and with colon removed, I also have Crohn’s Disease, but in remission for about six years. Was on trials for Remicade/Infliximab and continued with that from civilian infusion centers to the VA every six weeks. After the four abdomen procedures that I have had, I developed over 50 hernias in my gut area. Hernia surgeon in Seattle, said that repair surgery would 50/50% put me in a long term nursing facility for the rest of my life. All of these problems can NOT be determined as to a cause and that is frustrating as hell to me, why or what happened to me.  This May, 2017, I was diagnosed with a 40% compression fracture of my T12 vertebrae. At the time of the break, I had been on 150mcg of Fentanyl since about 2010, for the AVN mind you. In the hospital the doctors said that it would be good for me to get off of the fentanyl. After discharge I weened myself off of Fentanyl completely. Did it waaaaaay to fast and had excruciating withdrawls. I plugged along doing physical therapy for the back. In doing the exercises I aggravated my hip and had to go back on the Fentanyl. At the same time I got a new doc at the VA. Now the reason for my post. Sorry for the length but a little background on my issues, I feel would be ok to relay. Oh, had three ACL procedures while on active duty in the Army on left knee. When i had the last surgery my body was rejecting the screws and such. They now say that I will reject any hip procedure...this is why I am on Fentanyl. Want to have something done, but do not want to have complications from it.  Question is...in a roundabout way.... I was on massive dose of Fentanyl and am on Oxycodone for the horrible hernia pain. New doc put me on 12mcg and we had a standing agreement that we would go up to a level that I would get some pain relief. From 150mcg - two months off of Fentanyl and on 12mcg....needless to say when that week was over and still doing physical therapy, I had to go up in dosage. She sent me 25mcg. i still was sucking pond water and last week went to appointment but they had cancelled it that morning. Her nurse, new btw as well, didn’t relay to the doc that the 25mcg patches were not working and as we agreed I would go to the 50mcg. Which is where as a max, i would really like to stop.   So, I get home and when the 72hours were up, I put on two of the 25mcg patches on. I have been trying to scale back on The Oxycodone to get a little more life out of my liver, i know that is going to bite me on the ass sooner or later. Two days ago I had my annual urinalysis for the pain clinic, but ordered by my new doc. She got on me as to why my patches are going to be gone about five days earlier than she planned...I told her that I spoke to the nurse as you had cancelled my appointment with you last week. All would have been good go go, if my *** would have been straightened out through the nurse! Doc called today and told me that I showed up as a negative on my piss test...I was like WTF!!! Never heard of catching *** for negative. She said I am probably selling them... I was like..so, I went through the withdrawls, decreased my intake of Oxycodone and I am now selling the 12mcg and new dose 25mcg!!! I said, if I am selling them now, then why wouldn’t I have sold the 100mcg’s and 50mcg patches??   How am I showing up negative for both Oxycodone and Fentanyl? I read that since I have done a complete diet change and whatnot, juicing everyday and the minuscule dose might not be metabolizing correctly? Pain clinic doc and pharmacy tech can’t figure it out either but for past 14 years and five pain clinics, never a problem. Any thoughts...? the doc said that for me, and my history and illnesses, that she sent it (urine) to another lab for secondary screening. What is possibly going on here?   Please offer advice as I am really wondering and freaking out...is something wrong with me and urine test is messing up or what? Never been accused of breaking the law or lying before and it is pissing me off as well. Many thanks in advance.","Chronic Pain , Physical Therapy , Hip Pain , Medication , Back Pain"

They have progressed over the years to the point she is currently disabled with chronic daily migraines and cluster headaches. We have tried literally every type of treatment including biofeedback, opioids (and every other pain medication available), botox injections, acupuncture, kinesiology, physical therapy, massage therapy, hormone therapy, sleep specialists, pain management clinic, homeopathy and holistic medicine, psychology therapy, and the list goes on, I even took her to a witch doctor once, who actually helped her for awhile with herbs and supplements. She has also seen several specialists, including a University clinic for migraines. The only thing we haven't tried is a hyperbaric chamber because it is cost prohibitive ($950 per treatment and they say she will need a minimum of 150 treatments to start and then maintenance treatments). As we know, pain medications such as opioids are no longer an option. My feeling is that if she had diabetes and required insulin on a daily basis, that would be almost the same.

It hasn't really been the same since then. I picked yoga back and was feeling discomfort in my low back. I started to have pain after standing for long periods of time, relieved by bending forward. I started seeing a physical therapist and it seemed to be helping at first. I was doing better so he progressed me to the next level (one-legged bridges, bands, etc.). It seemed fine but I woke up the next morning with pain around the top of the low back on both sides. It was pretty sharp and hurt with each step. I told the physical therapist about it and he said it sounded like a different issue and seemed to think it was stress. I started having numbness in the low back as well.  That was almost a month ago. I decided to see a chiropractor, who told me I shouldn't do bridges. I wish I had listened. A couple weeks later, I went back to the physical therapist. He insisted bridges were fine. I did them and then a couple hours later had numbness. I woke up the next day to the worst pain I've had. I had an MRI done and they said I have a slightly protruding disc between l4 and l5 but nothing that explains my current pain. I am so much worst off than I was. Then a week and half ago, my dog jumped on me and I felt a sharp pain as I instinctively leaned back. That seemed to reaggravate it again. My pcp gave me a medrol prescription which helped a bit (haven't had numbness since I took it and I'm on the last day).

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/3434/my-obsessive-thoughts-are-killing-me-please-help,My obsessive thoughts are killing me! Please HELP!,"So here is my story in a summarized way: I am a 29 years old male. I was born and raised in the middle east. The way I was raised was very unhealthy. My parents were over protective and they spoiled me. I was living in my own world within my house. It felt safe and that nothing is awful out there. I had friends and we were playing all the time and then I would come back home to my fortress (house) where I feel great. I never had fear or anxiety and I never thought of such things or bad things could happen in the future. Thanks to my parents. I could say I had a happy childhood. Things started to worsen for me when I discovered that I like boys rather than girls. I experienced that heavily in high school. I was feeling the urge to spread my wings and set free to be who I was meant to be. I wanted to be a normal gay teen who has a healthy gay life. It was impossible in my country. Then when I was about 18 years old, I fell for a guy. It was mutual affection. He was 7 years older than me. He was everything I wanted to have in a guy from looks and manners. I fell in too deep for him. Here things started to change drastically for me. He began to be the center core of my interests. I couldn't see other things. I no longer was interested in spending time with my friends or family. I no longer have this geeky passion for video games and movies. All I wanted to do is be with him 24/7. After a few months and with the crazy amount of religious and cultural pressure, he said we could no longer do what we do! At that point, I felt as if a thunderbolt had fell on my head. I was no longer the safe invincible kid who was happy and felt that the world cannot harm him. I was crying rivers for the first time with unbearable pain and weight occupying my chest. My head felt heavy and tight as if someone was squeezing my brain. I was addicted to him like a drug and I knew it was unhealthy but I couldn't change it. I tried to change his mind over the course of a month or so, but he was not ok with it. Finally I decided to be take my pain and give up until some miracle takes place and make me forget about him. When I stopped contacted him. I was just in my room crying and in mental and physical pain all the time. My parents didn't know what to do and they couldn't know what was going on. Two weeks later my boyfriend approached me and he was wanting us to be back! I knew I shouldn't do it, but I had to do it because I was weak, pathetic and needed a relief for my dark pain. We resumed our relationship for a week and during that I was all normal again. Then he wanted to stop again. Things were on and off like that until one night I was completely breathless! I was suffocating and felt like my life was about to end! I was panicking. It went on for a few minutes, then I was ok... My father decided enough was enough and he forced me to go see a psychiatrist. Of course I could not tell him why I was feeling this, but I told him I had an emotional shock because my best friend had passed away. He diagnosed me with depression and hook me on fluoxetine 20mg one pill a day, two months later he increased the dosage to two pills, and later to three. It took around 2.5 years to get back on my feet and get over my ex, but I was still weak. I felt dependent on my family and the only way for me to feel content and safe is home around them. I basically couldn't have my own life and be independent. Later on, I started to think of my family and imagine scenarios that they will die and I will be all alone. What would I do, then? Life made no sense at all. I was miserable in college and living on campus was a living hell. I couldn't concentrate on my education nor could I do homework. I hate daytime and all I like is the night time where I stay up late. I skipped most of my days to be back home where I feel safe. I spent my time hanging out with my friends, listening to music, playing video games and watching movies. Somehow I managed to graduate from college, then I got a job and it was an extreme challenge for me getting up in the morning. I feel awful when I wake up thinking I have to go to work. I quit my job later and it felt good to just be home and stay with my family. However, thoughts never seemed to stop! I felt lost and couldn't find purpose in life. I see my friends growing up and getting married while I am stuck in the age of 18 when I got all messed up. I wanted to get married just to have a family, but I couldn't bear the idea of lying to myself and others. Honestly I even fear that I cannot be potent in bed with my wife if I chose to take that path. Later on, I got an opportunity to move to the US and I always wanted to move there where at least I could be myself. It felt good to do that and finally break free. When things got real and I got my visa, I started to get anxious again and all of my thoughts were upside down! I was torn to half. Part says go and the other says are you crazy? So I had to step on it and take the risk even though it was so much of a mental pain. I lived in the US for one year. I had so much fun, but life was extremely over challenging for a guy in a condition like mine. I felt homesick and my family was calling me daily to check on me. The only way it felt good is when I meet guys where I could have feelings for them. That was the only way to keep me going forward, but thoughts were always taking over. I was thinking that what if I fall in love with a guy and then fail? How am I supposed to have a family with no children to give you a purpose and sense of a family. Life was stressful and I was worrying and stressing out about hundreds of things. Then the only light I could see is to move back home to my shell where I don't worry about life challenges. I moved back, but things never stop. I feel like I need to be in control of everything going on! When my mom gets sick, I go insane. I want to change that. When I don't like my job, I just feel the urge to give up and do something else. Basically I am stuck in a loop of ongoing stressful negative thoughts and scenarios of the creation of my mind that they never seem to stop at all. They get triggered with any minor occurrence in my life or those around me. Now I got a new opportunity to move back to the US. In the beginning it felt good, but now when it is real, it scares the hell out of me. Life is moving forward and I am stuck doing nothing but worrying and thinking. I am almost 30 and I do not have a life literally. I need to study, work and have a healthy relationship with a guy that I cannot do here. What do you think I should do? Is there anyone who has been through something like this? Is there any medication that could help ease my mind and make me stop thinking?

I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I started Cymbalta about 4-5 months ago. This combined with clonazepam has completely countered my anxiety and depression. I no longer have panic attacks and have low anxiety, and very very rarely do I feel depression. When I started the medication, I was at 127 lbs. I am a very short girl (5' 1.5""). The Cymbalta made me want to start doing things again, like exercising and being productive in general. I had been very unhappy with my weight and started cutting back on calories and I now exercise every day. I make certain to get my recommended 10,000 steps, at least on weekdays. Most weekends I shoot for 5,000. I have kept this up and my goal weight was 110 lbs. I got there and was still unhappy so I made my goal weight 107 lbs. Today, I am at 106 lbs. My BMI is 19.8 and my body fat is at 15.64%. But, I look in the mirror and am still unhappy. All I see is fat. I even feel that clothes don't look good on me because my stomach is too big or something along those lines (this is the part of myself that I obsess over).  However, I'm not starving myself or anything. I tend to get hungry often, but usually ignore it as I have myself on a strict time schedule for eating. I generally have a bowl of oatmeal (1/2 cup with about 1/4 cup milk) with cinnamon and sugar or cranberry sauce for breakfast. I then eat a fiber bar at 1:30, a pb&j at 4:30, and a serving of pasta (56 g before cooking) with a cut up chicken strip in it and an apple on the side for dinner at 7:00. I also have a granola bar on my way home from work at 10:30. On the weekends, however, I typically eat too much. I will eat multiple large meals. Last week, I even ate 2 full pans of 6 cookies each. I tell myself I won't binge eat on the weekends but I inevitably always do.  Do I even have a problem, or is this normal? Do I have an eating disorder, or am I on the path of possibly having one? I would just like to know so that maybe I can change some things in my life. However, part of me wants to keep losing weight since I'm unhappy with how I look.

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/29735/pain-in-both-legs,Pain In Both Legs,"Okay, so I'll describe this the best I can. One night I was sleeping, and randomly woke up at 2 a.m. (as I often do). Nothing seemed wrong, but when I moved to get out of bed, pain immediately shot up both of my legs. It felt like every inch of my legs were hurting, and I had never felt such pain before. After ten full minutes, I thought about calling 911, but then the pain in my left leg subsided and most of my right leg stopped hurting, except for my calf and foot. I didn't do anything about it because I thought I might have just had a bad cramp. Now it has happened two more times (not as long, but the same things happens) and it lingers in my right leg for maybe six hours before fading away. I am away at school, so I don't have a doctor in the area, just my health center (who don't really deal with things other than flu, colds, stomachaches, etc.) and a very large hospital on campus. I went to the health center, and obviously they didn't know what to do, but suggested I went to the doctor. So I guess my question is, do I go to the hospital, or is it nothing serious? I know leg pain can be scary, but I don't want to waste time and money if it is not necessary. Medical background for help: I am not overweight, I do not workout but I walk at least three miles everyday, I do not eat very healthy but I also do not eat a lot. I have not injured either leg in years, and my legs do not cramp often. There is a history of heart disease on my mom's side. That's all I can think of.

Mental Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/mental-health/2339/unraveling,Unraveling,"Starting in middle-school I had started to become incurably sad. I would often skip school and stay at home and do nothing but play video games. My parents were going through divorce and would be constantly fighting. Eventually they split and my mother moved out. I had to live in two vastly different places at the same time.   My sadness only got worse as I had started High school. I saw everyone around me be sociable and active. They would go to school dances and hangout with friends, while I remained alone. I had some friends though, we never really started to see each other outside of school until the end of my freshman year. I had tried (American) Football and enjoyed it, though all my friends quit and it was just me and a lot of jock pricks. I had tried to align myself to their order but I saw that it was changing me for the worse, so I quit. I was bullied a bit for quitting, but I stood up for myself and they went away.   I had some better friends in my mid high-school career and I was alright, but I lacked companionship, a mate. I had been talking to a girl that I had liked and planned on asking her on a date but I had to wait because I was being friendly to another girl (who was a hoe) and wanted stop that before continuing. She found out, somehow, and ignored me. I was broken. I moved on though and tried to court another, but she had ignored me. I found another eligible companion but she was thoroughly not interested, but we were still good friends. I had invited her to a party and she brought a friend. I had become interested in her friend and she was clearly interested in me so after about a month of doing things together I asked her out. She said yes and we dated all throughout my junior year. She was a year older than me and she left to college and I had feared she would find someone else, but I would see her nearly every other week and we would talk on the phone often.   Over this last summer I was trying to build a computer, which went terribly wrong anytime I had tried. This caused bouts of deep anxiety and sadness that I had experienced in a long time. I drew parallels from it to my indecision of what I wanted to do with my life (Join the military and maybe pick up a few skills and become part of the labor force or go to college and study history to become an educated scholar). I had decided to go to college and I was accepted to a state university (which my college advisory in high school said I wasn't good enough for, *** him). We still talked regularly but we did not see each other as often because we each now had a lot of work. I had started to become very stressed, not because of the work, but because I couldn't get any loans. I had applied everywhere and couldn't get anything. I asked my family but they all turned me down and told me to get a Job (The only college educated person in my family had hers paid for by her parents, who also declined to help me)   Just before the semester ended at college I had became totally depressed. Nothing could make me happy. Every now and then I would say something I shouldn't have to my girlfriend (Who I was dating since high-school) and we would argue, further saddening me. At one point, she said she wanted a break from our relationship, I begged her not to go and tried to make myself happy for her. I was still depressed though, some nights crying myself to sleep, or taking long showers just wallowing in my own pity. Eventually I decided to stop caring, it was my apparently my fate to be forced from college. I would see my girlfriend during Christmas break and I would be with her to make up for myself and try and find an alternative.   No, she broke up with me. The night she was going to come spend the night with me and wash away our sorrow. She called me and said she felt like our relationship was too good. That there might be something were missing. I tried to talk to her and change her mind but she said she still loved me and didst feel like she should hurt me any more with her problems. I spoke to her friend and asked what was wrong and she said she just doesn't want to be in a relationship right now.   This made me incredibly depressed and sad and I could no longer live with myself. Why do these things keep happening to me? I had thought about suicide but a cracked article changed my mind. I've read many articles about mental health and I have tried to keep myself sane. It's only getting worse though.   I've ruled out suicide and have tried to keep myself away from those thoughts and tendencies. I have contacted a friend and let him know about my situation if it gets worse, he's promised to ""commit many blasphemies"" to help me.",Depression

Before I was let out from a week long stay in the hospital, They required me to begin seeing a therapist and psychiatric once a week. I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety and I was on meds. I kept seeing the therapist and after about six months of observing me and my behavior (I'd always had some things that were different but I just thought it was me), she asked me to take a small test to check something but she didn't tell me what it was. Apparently, it was a test to check my Aspergers Quotient. I had scored a 45 out of 50, which was apparently very high and she had already had a suspicion I had Aspergers, and this was just more evidence. she decided she wanted to get me diagnosed so she could start to get me meds, and when she told my mother this, my mother told her that if she tried to diagnose me, I'd be withdrawn from therapy, which meant no medication for anxiety or anything else. so, my therapist relented and I stopped seeing her about a year later. Then, a few years later, in high school, the subject came up again. My school had a Student Health Center, which was a doctors office in the school for kids who were unable to see a doctor otherwise. I saw this doctor a variety of times, and she wanted to have my mother come in, because she also suspected I had Aspergers and wanted to speak with her. My mother refused, and I was no longer allowed to see that doctor. Now, Im 17, less then 6 months from being 18, and since the doctor, roughly 3 years, whenever I show a symptom, for example, have a breakdown or go on and on about a subject (Usually, the revolutionary war), they will not talk to me or look in my direction until I act like a 'normal human being' again. This, as you can imagine, happens quite often, as they make no attempts to accommodate me. Its wearing me down, and I don't know what to do. I can't keep going on like this, and i can't move out for at least 5 months.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Depression"

When I was looking at my shoulder I realized that my right shoulder's acromion (scapula) is a little higher than my left shoulder (and I am not sure if the muscles around it are painful or the joint). It hardly can be noticed if you don't look at them carefully.  Today that I was looking at myself from the side, I realized that my right scapula looks slightly bigger than the left one on my back.  I have no idea if it was this way before or not. I just found it out. Here is my situation: - 32 years old man - one year and a half that I started going to gym for amateur bodybuilding. - I gained muscles during the last year. I was 132 lb in the beginning and now I am 147 lb. Now I am wondering what is the cause of the pain and this uneven shoulder. If it is because of weight lifting at the gym, why after a year? How can I treat it? Thank you in advance",Physical Therapy

Recently I had a friend who had to be intubated as a result of an inhalation injury. The entire time he was unconscious and has no recollection of being on a ventilator. This actually made him very mad because he did not like that fact that he cannot remember anything that took place and several days of his life are missing. I understand that there is a reason that intuabated patients are usually sedated, but to me, this sounds like a nightmare. I would never want to be put under to the point that I could not remember anything and I would not appreciate having that done to me. So the question is, can you refuse any sedation when being intubated? I am not just referring to being put to sleep, but also where you remain awake, but drugged to the point that you have no memory. I have heard that sedation is almost always done in these situations, but do you have a choice? I know I have seen people that were awake and fully aware while on a ventilator, but I do not know why it was done like that. I have also read about awake intubation, yet every time I read about it, it still talks about sedation, so I don't even think I understand what types of sedation there are.

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/25350/severe-pain-next-steps,"Severe Pain, Next Steps","Hi everyone! I'm a 26 year old female with multiple disc herniations and bulges down my lumbar spine. Unfortunately, I have a congenital defect with a narrower spinal canal than most. This causes any disc bulge or herniation to present more pain as already affecting nerves due to tightness from what I've been told. I had a spinal surgery (discectomy and laminectomy) at 19 years old level l2/l3 at Mayo Clinic in MN after being in severe pain for a year. After the surgery my pain was still present and essentially I had a steroid injection there several months after surgery. I had the injection and got up off of the table and was immediately pain free for the past 7 years. Fast forward to March of this year when my worst nightmare happened and the pain came back. My pain always presents itself in the left leg from hip to ankle. I tried PT and then MRI revealed same situation, herniation and bulging on multiple levels. I had an ESI done and after a month I was pain free again (Not sure if due to injection or inflammation flared down again.) Then August 14 comes around and I stupidly decided to go ahead and go to Boston for work (I live in Indy) when I woke up that morning in excruciating pain. I walked through both airports but when I got to baggage claim I had my coworkers get my bags and I left without them In a taxi straight to Mass Gen Hospital. By the time I walked inside ER I could barely function. They finally gave me a variety of pain meds but nothing even touched it. After sitting in ER for almost 12 hours they finally moved me to their observation unit where I spent two full days, again nothing touching pain. They did no imaging but did finally send in pain mgmt team who agreed to do ESI. They basically wanted to get me out of there and back to IN. I somehow was able to get on plane and home and my mom has been taking care of me for the past 5 weeks. No one in Indiana that I have seen seems very competent, mostly ortho surgeons and I'm not letting them do a spine surgery if it comes to that. Getting pain medicine is like pulling teeth thanks to all of the lovely people who have abused pills for so long. I did get in with a pain mgmt doctor that I saw with my last bout who has me on 600mg lyrica and 10mg oxycodone (I maybe take 1 or 2 per day as trying to ration and do not feel great taking it). He also did another ESI at the l2/l3 level this past Tuesday. I am currently trying to get back into Mayo Clinic as I feel Comfortable with their skills and treatment plans. I have tried PT for a week but my PT was basically at his wits end as I am at a pain level 8 for the past month and walk bent forward and to the left. He tried a variety of things with me and none seemed to give me any relief whatsoever. I am starting to get very depressed as I have a very successful career and life that I can not live. I spend most of the day in bed and my mom has to help bathe me, etc. I don't feel like myself at all and with back pain there is no forseeable end in sight.

When she does voluntarily come out of her room she is usually timid unless she gets interested in a conversation, then it ends up in a heated argument.

I was an Army Ranger my first four years and have been crewing CH47F helicopters for the past 14 years, in addition to standard and non standard Army training. After 8 years of overseas duty, 4 years spent in Afghan and Iraq, and countless combat missions, I developed degenerated discs and a bulging disc in my lower lumbar. Consistent physical fitness and good diet has surpressed the pain for years, and I still maintain great physical fitness. Unfortunately, in the past few months, ligaments connecting my L4 and L5 have weakened, causing those vertebrae to misalign thus pinching my sciatic nerve running down my left leg. The pain becomes excruciating after minimal distance walking or running. I have basically become immobile, a huge disadvantage that does not allow me to take care of my guys. OTCs are ineffective. Cold/heat packs don't work. Injections are inconvenient and only last a few hours. I am on Gabapentin which only helps in high doses that usually affects my judgement and puts me to sleep. Surgery has to wait, though doing so will just open up a can of worms. I am currently in Korea, and the military does not have a acupuncturist, but i am looking for one in the Korean economy. I do have an inversion table coming in the mail. Do lumbar support belts work? If so, which is best and most durable? Does the copper nylon have any effect on Sciatica? Any advice will help.

You've have exhausted that avenue.  That is actually a good thing because now you know, you must be in charge of healing yourself.  That will create a shift in your brain chemistry which will help enable to take charge of your condition. I had years of chronic back and neck pain as well as depression, a herniated disk with numbness down my leg. I gradually got better through acupuncture, yoga, biofeedback and being diligent about doing stretching and meditating every day. I wrote a book on the subject 20 years ago which points out that medicine is not your friend and about the run around people with chronic pain you get from traditional medicine. It works when you have a straightforward problem but, as you have discovered, you will get as many different opinions as practioners you see. No one knows for sure what the underlying problem is. My road to recovery (and I am totally recovered) took 5 - 7 years of persistent exercise.  I believe that a big component of your situation is anxiety, fear and desperation.  This binds all the muscles and joints in your body and exacerbates the problem. The cells in your body are constantly sending messages to your brain that everything hurts which, in turn, sends messages back to cells to reinforce the pain.  I am not a Doctor or Physical Therapist but i have helped dozens of people with chronic pain conditions. One of the keys is to change your thinking through support and biofeedback training.

I've been fighting depression on and off for the past 10 years and this past year it has been really bad due to a number of life changes that I wasn't ready for/didn't want. My wife and I separated and I was hoping it was only going to be for a little while but it is now at 5 months. I have felt like I lost her and she is really the only person I truly opened up to in my life but we were both going through different personal struggles at the same time and it was obvious to me that if we ever wanted to have a chance to fix it, we would have to separate for a time. I tried to convince myself that it was over so that I could grow as a person, but I never fully felt like it was. In continually trying to distance myself from her I have severely burnt that bridge, and it has been very hard to understand.  I left my home and moved back in with my Mom, again hoping it would be temporary. Of course, it hasn't been, but everything is in limbo and I really just want to have a home again that is mine. Additionally, I left my job of eight years without a plan of action on getting a new one, figuring that it was time for me to move on from that aspect of my life as well. I left on good terms, but it was not the best decision in retrospect. That's where I am up to now when it comes to my current dilemma. I accepted a job in a new city. My brother's fiancee worked for the company and helped me get it. It was not a job that I really felt was right for me, but I told myself that it was and so I moved in with my brother and fiancee last week. I was quickly overwhelmed and flooded with sadness and anxiety. Nothing felt ""right"" about where I was or what I was doing. I attended the first day of orientation and was panicking all day--everyone else was so happy to be starting work with this company and I was not, I was scared and miserable. I didn't really want to talk to anybody after weeks of psyching myself up to being my former social self... At the end of the day I tried convince myself that it was first day jitters but that it all hit me...I couldn't stay there...That night I couldn't sleep and the feelings of sadness and depression hit so hard that I couldn't breathe. I felt as though this was my last shot at redeeming my life...I couldn't go ""home"" to my wife, because that life is essentially over, I couldn't go home to my Mom because I knew she would be so disappointed and let down. I felt trapped and at that point, contemplated suicide...But in the end, I called my Mom and told her what I was feeling and asked if I could come back to stay with her a bit longer (but of course, the last thing I wanted to do, she had dealt with me enough). I got up and told my brother and his fiancee what I was feeling and of course they didn't understand and were upset that I wasn't giving this change a chance. I know I disappointed them as well--burnt another bridge. I let them down, but I had to leave.  But what was I leaving for? Nothing really...the same sad life I have been living for the five months since I left my wife and my job.  I don't really know what to do or where to go from here. I need to find a purpose and was wondering if anyone out there has gone through a similar situation and if they were able to come out of it.

After a few days rest, he did a lot of yard work; lifting many very heavy bags of gravel and bricks. The pain got much worse and after a few weeks he is in almost excruciating pain. He is in constant pain,though it is much worse in the evening and morning. He cannot sleep because of his shoulder pain. He cannot walk, lie down or sit. Now it is the shoulders, arms and wrists and hips. His knee is swollen where he had ACL replacement 18 years ago,and it never gave him a problem before. The RA and ANA tests were both negative and everything elsewas fine,but his sugars were 380! They are normally a little high, but not ever that high. ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, aspirin, norco, none work at all. No fevers or rash. no headaches.

I had dressed it with a dry bandage, but this morning it was covered in puss and. I cleaned it with water and a cotton ball (which seemed to cause some skin to come off) and cut up a Hydrocolloid bandage (CVS brand ""Advanced Healing Bandage"") and placed it over the burn (only about a half an inch long.) I have been seeing on some sites including WEBMD that dry bandages are recommended, but I wonder if its okay to use Hydrocolloid since it is NOT supposed to stick to the wound (although last time I used one it did and since my wound isnt bloody it may stick?) or if I should use a compress and gauze? I'm also not sure how often to change a Hydrocolloid bandage, last time it puffed and I took it off and it removed the new layer of skin so I'm a bit skeptical, but this seems to be the best way to prevent infection.",

When I am working out I do not experience any pain.

It is usually worse when lying on my back or on my affected side (usually the right). When I have the pain it is really bad and keeps me up tossing and turning all night since I cannot get comfortable. Also, do to me trying to stay off the affected side, it usually then causes my other hip to become painful from constantly being on that one. This has been a chronic problem that I have had on and off for multiple years. I had an MRI done about a year ago, but was not currently in a flare-up at the time. The MRI just said that it saw some mild hamstring tendinosus and pincer-type femoral acetabular impingement.

Nobody understands and is just too busy to talk to me. When I am talked to in an condescending manner or feel the person I am talking to is angry at me, I just feel that much worse. When I try to tell them how I feel, it makes them angry? Today just keeps getting worse and worse. Circumstances the last month or so have really worn me down and it feels like no one really cares about spending time with me when I need it. The only time I get any attention is when somebody wants something from me (my time, my labor, my money, my possessions). I am tired of it. Really feeling down. My husband and my grown children will do many things to please others but seem to never have time for me. Example (Daughter has a step mother-in-law who has caused much grief in her husband's family for several years. Now they are all trying to mend things and are bending over backwards to please this woman to bring peace in their family. They want me to be okay with her calling the shots with their time over the holidays, weekends, etc. I am not happy with this and will not pretend to be. The first time things don't go her way, she will have a tantrum, the family will not speak for a while and then they give in and it starts all over again. ) That is just one example if things I put up with. I just keep on putting up with things that bother me until I get angry, then anxious and depressed at the same time. I have always let others run over me, even as a child, and I the way I get back to feeling half way normal is to cry and loss my temper. I then become afraid that my husband and children will not love me. Then I start the cycle again. Holding everything in, getting angry, then getting anxious and depressed. Wish I could overcome this. I know what is happening but feel powerless. I still have a good brain (143 IQ) and can function to take care of all my household chores, bill paying and paperwork, growing shopping, etc. I am just so tired of feeling anxious and depressed. This robs me of untold hours and day of happiness of just plain serenity. I am looking for others who might just listen to me when I am down.

I'm at my wits end! I don't know what to do, I'm only a 19 year old female. Any advice or comments, suggestions, inferences or hypotheses as to what could possibly be going on with me would greatly appreciated. (writing this with shaky hands), here's a little in sight of what's been going on/ when it started and the symptoms i've been experiencing. I've wrote down the dates from day 1 to present (which might be a little off) *Prior to the first date i've listed below, I was experiencing other symptoms over the course of a month but gradually. Fatigue, feeling like I was in a fog most of the time, trouble remembering things, concentrating, just didn't feel all there. I noticed my right eye felt as if it wasn't as strong as my right one (blurriness). My right ear also felt plugged all the time followed by a pain on the right side of my face that was connected from my ear to my jaw that lasted a little more than a month but has now subsided. Things such as clumsiness, tingling in my hands and feet and weakness were also experienced. *May 27th 2017* Was when I first went to the ER for an excruciating headache, I was given an IV + headache medication, I felt this feeling of general discomfort throughout my body as the medication was going through the IV to my arm (have not felt the same since, it was like an irritable feeling that I still sometimes experience.) A few days after that I began to feel very shaky and just not okay. Was still having problems with my right eye, was also continuing to suffer from the intense headache listed above but it was now causing a burning sensation in different areas of my head and the back of my neck. This headache and feeling of pressure/ burning sensations continued on for about a week or so.  *June 3rd* was STILL experiencing this same headache/pressure and burning sensation, so I went back to the ER. After waiting for 4hrs+ at the ER just to see the doctor, he examined me and didn’t think anything too serious of the headache suggesting a possible sinus infection. I told him I didn’t think it was just a sinus infection after mentioning a history of brain tumour in my family, I asked for a CT scan of my head just to make sure. Hesitant to give me the CT scan because of his doubt that there was anything seriously wrong (such as a brain tumor) he prescribed me sinus infection medication and sent me on my way. *June 7th Went back to the ER with the same severe persistent headache and burning sensations throughout my head and neck along with a few new symptoms that presented themselves such as weakness as well as a burning sensation on the top of my legs. I was seen by a different doctor this time, who thought a CT scan was in my best interest. I agreed to the CT scan of the brain which came back as in fact sinus inflammation in the brain. I was given RAN- CLARITHROMYCIN 500MG & PMS-DEXAMETHASONE 4 MG. Although a sinus infection was the only thing to come of the CT scan, the symptoms I had been experiencing and explained to the doctor earlier ex. burning in my neck and head, trouble with my right eye, intense migraines, clumsiness, cognitive issues (poor memory, unable to concentrate) ""brain fog"", muscle weakness, suggested him to believe it could be something more, he mentioned a possibility of MS and told me he was going to order an MRI of my brain to rule it out.  *After taking the medication for the sinus infection the headaches did stop*. From June 7th - 16th awaiting the MRI of my brain the doctor from the ER had ordered I was very stressed and depressed about thinking MS was what was causing all these symptoms. I was under extreme amounts of stress. At this time I started noticing the fatigue becoming worse where I would just have to lay down due to feeling very weak and physically exhausted. Also at this time I noticed I was having sleep troubles. I would have a hard time falling asleep even to just nap even though my body was so tired, my brain would just not allow me to sleep. At night time especially I would also have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep as I would wake up every couple hours. I also noticed I'd developed a slight tremor in my right hand/arm whenever I would lay down. The tremor was not as noticeable to the naked eye as it was within my body, it would keep me awake as well due to just being uncomfortable. Within the next two weeks of experiencing these symptoms I also noticed a decrease in my weight. I lost a total of 14 pounds unintentionally, but possibly due to extreme stress.  *June 17th I had the MRI of my head. The tremor in my hand/arm got slightly worse as you could now see a slight shake with the naked eye, I also noticed my legs would twitch while laying down and feel as if they had a slight vibration to them coming from the inside. *June 19th exhausted from only getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night accompanied by the weakness in my body and tremor, I also noticed an irritable feeling in my upper back from time to time making it very uncomfortable to lay down or to sit for long periods. It felt almost as if I had restless back syndrome that persisted throughout the day and the night. Sometimes this feeling would go into my arms, as well as the burning sensations on the top of my legs continuing to persist. *June 22 Was my appointment with the neurologist to discuss my prior MRI scan of my brain to see if MS was the reason behind these symptoms or not. I and was told by the neurologist my brain scan was clear having no lesions, and that MS was ruled out. After explaining to the neurologist my still existing symptoms they did a physical neurological exam confirming it was still not MS. They then suggested an anti anxiety medication. I had an appointment with my family doctor that following day, and explained the persisting symptoms I was still having. My doctor also related it back to anxiety and prescribed me with an antidepressant/anti anxiety medication which I have not taken because I do not agree that these symptoms are from anxiety. As well as ordering more blood work, checking levels, deficiencies and ruling out any other scary things such as Lymes, Lupus, RA, & crohn's disease. *All blood work has came back normal, and negative for any autoimmune/rheumatic diseases*.  A few weeks later with still no answers and the same persisting symptoms, along with some new ones that are becoming quite concerning. I’m now experiencing widespread pain throughout my body. These pains come and go hitting my body in different areas giving me extreme muscle pain mainly in my back, forearms, shoulders, hips, knees and buttocks. The pain intensifies in different areas, the other day I woke up with my upper back aching for hours and then it would move down to my lower back. Then the next day my back wouldn't hurt any more but my left forearm would be in excruciating muscle pain as if I'd just exercised heavily the day before (which I did not). Other extremities such as my ankles, hands, feet, toes and fingers would just ache,pain and almost feel like little electric shocks(mainly in fingers and toes), throughout the day accompanied by the burning sensation. I am still not able to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night. I’ve woken up overheating and sweating, not being able to swallow. A rash that appeared out of nowhere on my neck (went away after an hour) along with a very flushed face. Restless back and leg pain (in the day and at night). At this point I just don’t know what to do!!

I am currently taking Naproxen and Metoclopramide which are effective most of the time, but not always convenient to take. I usually wake up with a migraine in the morning, or start to feel one coming and take a nap if I can which makes me wake up with a full-blown migraine. In the last few months I have noticed that I am getting more than the odd muscle spasm or twitch. When I was fist diagnosed with migraines I would sometimes get a shooting pain and jerk in my right thumb. Now i am getting the same thing but worse mainly in my right thigh but also other parts of my body. These mostly happen when I am in bed.

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/22642/ultra-frequent-ovarian-cysts,Ultra-Frequent Ovarian Cysts,"A bit of a background... I'm a 27 year old female with a history of endometriosis and the occasional ovarian cyst. I had a laparoscopy and subsequently was on Lupron when I was 17 years old and have been taking various birth controls ever since... I haven't had much of any reproductive issues since I've been on birth control, in fact I completely forgot what a cyst felt like, but in December I decided to switch from the weekly birth control patch and commit to an IUD. Mirena was the one recommended to me at my annual. After getting over the initial cramping and state of shock my uterus was in (which tapered off after a couple weeks) I started to notice some sharp and achey pains in my lower right abdomen, right where I would assume my ovary is. These pains would last anywhere from a few seconds to about 10 minutes... I got in the habit of carrying Menstridol around with me everywhere I go, which always seemed to help if it didn't go away on it's own. The pain level would be anywhere from about a 4, a dull achey pain... to about a 9, a sharp achey pain that would start pretty dull and gradually crescendo into what I could only assume is a cyst rupturing. These more severe cases would typically be accompanied by spotting. The frequency of the incidents is what's alarming to me. I hardly ever go a day without a symptom, and the most extreme symptoms are happening a couple times a week. Part of me assumes my body needs time to adjust and this is a side effect that will work itself out and become less frequent. However, now it's 9 months later and it hasn't slowed down/become less severe at all. In fact, just a couple nights ago I had the worst experience yet, I was woken up 3 separate times with level-9, cyst-rupturing pains. Is this something that other people experience with IUDs? Is there something more serious going on with me that I should be concerned about? Also, is it odd that this is ALWAYS occuring on the right side?

PT was going good until around 8 weeks when I started feeling this bad pain in my right kneecap/ patella tendon area. The pain would not go away so at 12 weeks when I was suppose to start doing light jogging exercises, I was not able to. The pain is getting better but it is holding me back because I feel I cant attempt to jog because the pain might be that strong. I also had to stop doing certain things at physical therapy because of the pain. I am not doing PT anymore because my surgeon told me he was going to stop me at 12 weeks plus he wanted me to rest some so maybe the pain would go away. I see him next week. I am currently taking a strong anti inflammatory medicine but the pain still is there.  I am 21 years old and play competitive basketball so I need to be able to progress and get back but I dont even know how to start to return to jogging or anything with this pain. My doctor might not order me more PT but I can ask him to. My biggest concern is this pain and not understanding why it wont go away and how to progress and move forward and insure that I am able to return to my sport. What should I do?

It does the job without any side effects because 2.5mgs are too few to put me into a stoned state. Problem: insurance. They want to insure dronabinol for cancer patients, for appetite, vomiting, that sort of thing. Dronabinol is available out of pocket from $500 to $1200 for 30 pills.

I went to the E.R the Doctor did a Heart check with those cables, Electrocardiogram ECG, Xrays, and checked me physically, He also used the Stethoscope to hear my chest, back. The heart is perfect he said, xrays good, he said it could either be my muscles maybe. He said I can go to a Cardiologist to check more in detail. I went to a Cardiologist and he did the same test Electrocardiogram ECG, he checked my lungs with his Stethoscope and had an interview with me. He said he didn't need to do nothing because he has too much experience and has deal with the same issue too many times, he said I don't have any lungs, heart, chest issues.

It showed that some damage was done to my left hip socket, which they thought was caused by overstretching and my hyper-mobility. Their solution was for me to get fysiotherapy, the fysio told me to ice my hip twice a day for 20 minutes and I had an appointment twice a week, after I only started to get more pain and get more behind in dance I decided to swap fysiotherapists.  The new therapist told me I had a snapping hip and that and the pain was caused because of bad posture and weak abdomen. At the time I was auditioning for dance schools as well where one of the fysio's at the medical check told me he thought the tissue in my hip was infected and suggested getting an injection if I didn't recover before the start of the school year. Luckily I recovered quickly with the exercises I got. My hip has been fine ever since and I had been working to get my flexibility back. My posture and abdomen are a lot better and I still do the given exercises. However about two months ago my movement range started to decrease. I'm fine doing static stretches, but my actual ""working"" moving range has started to decrease (the hip doesn't hurt) and this came with pain in the left side of my lower back. There is some sort of bruising visible on the left side lower back (where the dimple is), but it doesn't look like a typical bruise.

He used to suffer from asthma and allergy when he was little. Thus he could not do much of outside sports when growing up. Apart from being an A+ student, he mostly spent time watching TV and playing video games. He was always a good kid and didn't need much of disciplining. However, things started changing since last year when he started high school. His grade started going down. And anytime I confronted him about his grades or missing homeworks he would cry profusely. He sometimes would sit inside his closet and cry and wouldn't want to come out for hours. I thought these were teenage mood swings. But then I started noticing him writing stuff like, ' I hate life', ' Help'. So I spoke to the school psychologist. After talking to my son she suggested that I should take him to an outside psychologist. Long story short, after seeing multiple psychologists and psychiatrists, I've started him on Prozac 20mg for almost a month. But one thing that really baffles me is, when my son is with his friend in the house playing video games he is all excited and happy. I see him chuckling listening to YouTube videos. But whenever it's about school or any responsibilities, he seems out of energy. Another thing that confuses me is he is looking at his phone and listening to videos the moment he gets out of school till he goes to sleep. He can't be without his phone atall. I tried taking his phone away for an hour a day but he kept on arguing. I had to cave in. To me it seems more like phone addiction than depression.

The pain is sharp and wraps from my breast bone to my left upper rib area under my breast and all the way to my back to the left of my spine. It hurts to sit the most. Exercise and even walking hurt sometimes.  This past January I had a ""flare up"" after doing normal exercises. I decided to rest completely and did so for 6 MONTHS.

I saw an orthopedist, physiatrist and neuro surgeon. i had a CT and MRI, a cyst was found on my nerve on my spine along with a ""subtle cortical and trabecular thickening of my 10th rib"" I was told the cyst could be causing this pain and likely I was misdiagnosed a few years ago.

It started because I had very poor posture when sitting at the computer hunched over for long periods of time. When the pain first occurred, it was so severe that I stayed up all night screaming. The day prior I felt a little soreness in my shoulder, but when the pain came full force I could not even sleep. I never went to the hospital at the time, which I probably should have. The pain lasted for a few days and then I woke up the following morning with a winged scapula. My shoulder blade protruded 2-3 inches from my back for about 3 months. I tried going to physical therapy and few times but found it was not working and it was also too expensive ($100 per visit). The winged scapula finally went away on its own, but a lingering pain remained. When I put pressure on the exact point of the pain, it feels much better. This is only temp. relief. I've found that heavily working my arms and shoulders temporarily numbs the pain as well (ex. Boxing, weightlifting). When I get busy with work and spend long hours at the computer and standing up, my shoulder pain gets far worse. It comes back nearly full force to the night 4 years ago when I could not sleep. I've seen 6 specialist doctors and 1 chiropractor in the 4 years I've had this issue. Doctor #1 put me on steroids and said it would go away by itself in 1 year Doctor #2 gave me an EKG test and saw some failed nerves of the long thoracic. the test was performed with a needle which was inserted into my back , moved around and then repeated for an hour. Very painful. He also stated the pain would go away and that nerves repair themselves. he prescribed muscle relaxers. They made me very sleepy and it became hazardous to work/drive. Doctor #3 wanted to shoot me with steroids directly into the area of pain. I said no because I did a lot of research online and found it could have permanent damage if done so. Doctor #4 wanted to do another EKG test, I declined because that had already been done and did not go back to him. Chiropractor #1 Cracked my neck and my back for 3 weeks, twice a week. and I saw no results. Doctor #5 said that I needed physical therapy, I did not attend because of failure in the past plus cost of treatment.
