The doctor was very compassionate to my problems. I have insomnia, anxiety and depression. On first visit he prescribed Trazodone for my insomnia. Waited for 3 days to get antidepressant. He wanted to see what meds to go together with Trazodone. He ordered Lamictal (generic name) and told me to take at bedtime alone with the Trazadone. So whats left for me to take during daytime. I am without a med and depressed during the day. There's something wrong with this picture. I heard about mood stabilizers that work together with antidepressants.  Does he know that I am depressed during the day? The Lamictal I take at bedtime doesn't carry through the next day. If a sleeping pills good, it should carry its own. Should I question him as far as ""what about the day, I have nothing to take for my depression?""  cindigal","Depression , Bipolar Disorder"

I am seeking help. I have withdrawn from benzos (4mg Klonopin) and opioids (200mg Oxycodone) at the beginning of this year. The benzodiazepine taper took 6 months. The Oxycodone was cold turkey. Anyways, at the moment I suffer from a groin injury for a few weeks now that hurts pretty bad at night which keeps me awake. So I tried to take Oxycodone on occasion. However, suddenly, the Oxycodone causes pain at two spots in my body that have been injured previously. My right wrist and my right shoulder. Everytime I take Oxycodone, those to spots start to hurt. I had a wrist strain a year ago and a shoulder bursitis. Both injuries healed (MRI was done). But still, the Oxycodone causes the same pain in those areas that I had a year ago. Now I am wondering if it has to do with the fact that I have withdrawn from the benzos. It seems Oxycodone indirectly lowers GABA and that opioid induced pain can be caused by NMDA and 5HT-3 receptor overactivity - both receptors go into overdrive during benzodiazepine withdrawal and both can cause pain. I also notice that I get muscle tightness in my neck and jaw after taking Oxycodone. Something that I never had when I took Oxycodone years ago before I used benzodiazepines. I have read that opioid induced hyperalgesia is pretty common. However, why do only those previously injured spots start to hurt when I take a medication that is supposed to help with pain? My groin injury is so bad that I need opioids to sleep, but it gives me aching pain in my wrist and shoulder that it is not of a big help. What's the mechanism behind this phenomen? Could it really be the GABA deficiency and NMDA overactivity I am suffering from due to benzo withdrawal or is there more to it? Kind regards!",Chronic Pain

The first problem is my joints, my knees and ankles crack each time I take a step, they are usually sore by the end of the day if I am walking a lot, all of the joint in my body can easily crack without me purposely trying to crack them. If I pull on my arms, my shoulder can kinda pop out, and you can see the top of the joint, it doesn't hurt and pops back in. When I went to a doctor for this, he told me I was just a cracky person. Another problem that started around the same time is that my feet would turn dark purple like a bruise in the shower, and kinda greyish blue when I would get cold. I would also easily get chilblains, I ended up getting a few blood tests which all came up with nothing, so I got diagnosed with cyanosis and they told me to not go out in the cold, this year I got a new doctor which just told me I had raynauds syndrome, neither doctor did anything about it. Recently this problem has worsened where I get temporary bruising all over my knees after the shower, I added pictures of this below.

I recently got injured moving a slate pool table! Short story.... My hand got caught underneath and the group of guys tried to remove the weight as quickly as possible but my hand started bleeding obviously! The majority of my injuries are on my left hand knuckles primarily! I have provided a photo, because I'm not sure if it is healing at all or if I should go to a clinic. I can't close my hand fully cause the majority of the skin is missing and I'm assuming that it will just need a lot of time to heal! Let my know what you gather from the photo and if I should go to a clinic or let it heal on its own!",

Living with pain level from a 7-10 24/7. Plus weekly if not daily migraines when I hit a 9/10 and start throwing up.  I have tried every procedure possible and 3 surgeries still recovering from my third they said it would take a year to heal. I had a 50/50 change it would get better and a chance it would get worse. So far it's gotten worse.  I'm seeing my 6 physical therapist who is by far the best I have ever had. But he can't believe the life I live. In his own words it brutal and al you are doing is trying to survive. I take my meds as prescribed and when I hit a 9 or 10 and get my migraines and can't stop throwing up so can't take my meds , I have to get get pain shots to help me be able take my meds later that day and get it back down to a 7 again.  I have a doctor who I have been with for over 25 years and knows my history and my pain, I have a pain doctor but unfortunately they can only do so much, I have my surgeon, and physical therapist.  I don't wish my life on anyone. I don't run any errands or make any appts until after 1 pm because by 11:00 am I will know what my day will be like and if I have to stay in bed or make it to my appts. or be able to do 2 small errands.  If my husband and I get invited someplace it takes me 3-4 days to plan on getting ready, taking a bath, washing my hair, then what I can wear, get up early that day so I can get make up on etc... and when I do I look "" normal"" and I'm sure people think oh right how much pain can she be in? When I go people are like oh you must be so much better you look so good. I just smile and say I'm hanging in there.... what am I going to say tell them just be glad I took a bath and washed my hair? Which I need help with. I have to say before the last 17 years I was working 2 jobs, had a 16 year old wonderful son, friends, engaged, etc... how life changes when you get hurt the way I did. I still have a wonderful son who calls at least once a week to check on me, not very many friends they just didn't understand chronic pain and I guess got tired of me having to cancel plans, I have a ex who could not understand or have the empathy you need when someone is in pain and he worked in a hospital just didn't bring any compassion home, lost the jobs, can't work, lost the great medical insurance, lost the new home I put the down payment on, and lost so much more.. so if you have never been in chronic pain trust me it's not in my  ""mind""","Chronic Pain , Headaches , Neck Pain , Physical Therapy , Migraines"

I've tried psychotherapy, and countless drugs/combos, but nothing has ever worked. However, like I do every few years I tried to deal with this, and I came across reports about how B 12 worked for some people, so I thought ""why not?"". After the injection I almost immediately felt something, and by the next day I thought to myself ""this is how people ""feel"". I joined a few groups, took up a sport, got a few jobs around the house done, and instead of collapsing at the end of the day, I instead did paperwork, and was proactive in so many ways. I was psyched at the miraculous turn around. After about 10 days the feeling of wanting to be active and engaged wore off, and though the injection is supposed to last for about a month, I got another. Unfortunately there was absolutely no positive feelings like the first injection. I tried again weeks later, and again nothing.  This is not a terrible thing. What I now know is that there is some sort of imbalance going on, or at least something going on inside of me which can be tweaked by medicine. Before the injection I thought I was one of the few who cannot be cured of depression, but now I do see a way to live a normal happy life(felt so good while driving to belt out a tune with pure joy"").  So with that I'm wondering if anyone out there has any input into this situation.

Whenever even the most minute issue arises, I assume the worst and become paralyzed by fear, unable to focus on anything else but what ""might"" be wrong (and most of the time the ""might"" corresponds to something with astronomical odds). Two days ago, I was walking my dog outside and coming in through my back door. When I bent down to take her leash off (still on the back porch), I felt something sting me on the underside of my left arm. The pain was on my upper arm on the side nearest my chest. The pain lasted for about a minute or so, was very sharp, and the spot tingled some. Upon closer examination, I couldn't find a bug, but found two tiny pricks in my skin.  My back porch is near a swamp and is a sanctuary for bugs of all varieties, so it could have been anything. There's no swelling at the bite site, no real blood, and I haven't had any other symptoms. The source of my anxiety is that two years ago I saw a bat hanging from my porch. Frankly, I don't see how I could have been bitten by a bat without knowing it. Additionally, the bite is on the inside of my arm, so the bat would have had to come up from underneath me somehow (yes, I know this is crazy). I didn't feel anything bump into me. I haven't seen a bat on my porch in two years.  Things I have seen on my porch recently include: spiders (so many spiders -- I pulled one out of my hair today!), gnats, flies, giant mosquitoes, ladybugs, and another bug I can't identify. It's also possible that one or both of the marks could be from my puppy, who play bites me constantly. I thought about going to the doctor today, but realized how crazy this sounds. I took pictures of the marks and sent them to my mom. She thinks the likely cause is a spider. Should I go to the doctor? Rabies is always in the back of my (catastrophizing) mind, but I realize there isn't any doctor who would give me a rabies vaccine based only on this. How do I control my fear?

Last fall I began waking up with my left knee hurting. Usually I'd just stretch and feel better, but I didn't really think about it. By January, I was walking with a limp and in pain, taking OTC pills to relieve it. I saw a doctor in February, she ordered bloodwork, an xray, and that I do some stretches as she thought I had sciatica. The xray didnt reveal anything special, nor did the bloodwork. After doing her stretches for a week, I could barely walk and felt severe pain. My parents pressured me to go to a chiropractor, and that's what I did. After some sessions, the chiropractor encouraged me to get an MRI on my lower spine. I did and it revealed that I had two protruding discs (L4 and L5-s) and he said I should try spinal decompression. After about 12 sessions of that, the pain only got worse. I stopped seeing him and have tried some stretches. While seeing him, my knee started popping. When asked, he said it was probably a leftover high school football injury, but my knee didn't pop before this. Overall, my pain has gotten better, but I'm nowhere near where I want to be. It has shifted, mostly condensed in my left knee and buttock, but it has moved to my hip. My question is, what could I possibly have? Who should I see? Why is my knee suddenly popping? Could that be caused by sciatica? Or is there something else happening?

As a lot of you may already know, there is a well-known show on the telly called catfish, which is fairly big in America. I'm not sure if you all know what a catfish is but in this case, it is a person on the internet who portrays themselves to be someone that they're not (not the actual fish that swims). This is most commonly done with appearances. (i.e: you are sending people photos of another person who is not you). A lot of people do this to scam others into sending them money, gifts, vacations, etc. But there are others who just do it to get affection from others because they don't feel as though their true appearance would garner that same affection.  I'm embarrassed to admit but I happen to be the ladder. I began catfishing men on the internet at first, somewhat innocently (well as innocent as you can possibly get doing such a thing) just having casual conversations and getting some attention. But then I met one man in particular who fell for me quite quickly (my personality but it probably had SOMETHING if not alot to do with my fake appearance and/or he's under the guise I'm an honest person), and now it's been several months. I have feelings for him as well. but I'm too afraid to tell him. I plan on doing it soon though and I expect he will break up with me. But that is not why I'm writing in. I truly believe that I have some sort of mental illness that I could be capable of doing such a horrible thing to someone just to gratify a need within myself. I almost don't even recognized myself. I've always been a really good hearted girl with good morals and values....but over the last couple of years, I've gained weight and feel horrible about my appearance. I hate even leaving the house.

My first apt was the 7th of this month and it was a long appointment lol But w/o going into all the details, what he decided to do (at least Plan A) is to at the same time, wean off Nardil and add Marplan. I started this last week, and the way he is having me do this is that first, I reduced to 30mg (I was on 45mg) and stay on that for 1 week. Then add 10mg Marplan (which I did yesterday) but keep on 30mg Nardil. Then next week, reduce to 15mg Nardil and add 10mg Marplan, then following week, completely off Nardil, then up to 30mg Marplan and possibly going up 10 more mg after that. What doing that appears to be doing is ""tricking"" my body so that I can go off Nardil without getting sick. (I know, not medical explanation lol). He's hoping that will be the case until completely off one and on the other. He said that he didn't think that Marplan would have the same adrenaline issue as Nardil and he hopes it will be better re anti-depressant. But, if I don't do well on Marplan, at least I will be off Nardil and it shouldn't be too hard on my system to wean off Marplan, and then he would try non-MAOI meds. I've been very impressed with him and like him and he even convinced the financial assistance dept to approve my ap, saying that I wouldn't be with him long term, but to get me stabilized on meds.

Also, I have realized that I have a habit of doing things that keep me at home... Missing Dr's. appointments, not going to the market unless I'm starving and then I don't leave until it's like 15-10 minutes before the store closes(it's only a couple of blocks away) I don't like crowded places, never liked parties and really dislike being introduced to people. I have pretty much always disliked people in general, preferring the company of animals. I have a deep seated distrust of everyone.... I feel they all have ulterior motives and find they usually do. I find my inner voice (GUT FEELING) is never wrong,and have regretted the times I ignored it.  But I digress.  I panic when I have to go somewhere, can't sleep at all the night before and I'm usually late, if I show up at all.  My Dad's funeral is September 30th in northern California...

I do not have bipolar disorder, though, I have been tested by a new psychiatrist and correctly diagnosed with Avoidant Personality Disorder, Chronic Recurrent Depression and Anxiety Disorder (both secondary to the AVPD). I am responding well to TMS, and cognitive therapy, but the years of drug use have taken a huge toll on me physically (chronic headaches, thyroid disorder, chronic insomnia, weight gain, metabolic disorder), and I have also lost my nursing career for twenty years, plus retirement. The doctor was cash only, as he didn't take Medicare, and most of the time, I was on up to seven different medications at a time, which destroyed my relationship with my spouse. I spent my son's entire life on psychotropic medications, and now at 19, he has psychological issues as well, due to my not being there for him emotionally as he grew up. Because I have just received my correct diagnoses in May 2016, after actual written and genetic psychological testing, I have a year to file a lawsuit against the previous psychiatrist, but I am having a very hard time finding a California attorney who will take a psychiatric malpractice suit. I live in southern California, and would greatly appreciate any referrals that anyone can give.

My story begins with a total hip replacement (left) in March of '14. Not the greatest outcome, but better than what it was. By December of '14 I was back to having extreme hip pain in my left hip. X-ray showed growth of HO, and it was removed in June of '15. No problems until about January, when an x-ray showed the HO grew back with a vengeance. This time in June '16 we did radiation treatment the day before the surgery and the morning of. My Ortho told me that he removed everything. Hip was fine until about January of this year, and it was bad. MRI ruled out any problems with the implant, but showed fluid around it. Hip was drained and fluid cultured, but no infection. Now onto an MRI on my Lumbar spine. This is the results:1. Mild multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine without thecal sac or significant neural foraminal narrowing. There is stable mild narrowing of the right neural foramen at L5-S1. 2. Mild levoscoliosis of the lumbar spine. Mild (grade 1) retrolisthesis of L4 on L5. 3. When compared to the prior MRI lumbar spine study from 8/15/2015, there has been interval development of atrophy and fatty infiltration of the left psoas and iliacus muscle. This correlates with a territory supplied by the left L1-3 lumbar spinal nerves and parts of the left femoral nerve. Now off to an EMG next week (Oh the fun..). Has anyone else been through this? What can I expect? All I know is that I have extreme pain in my hip/groin/upper thigh, along with numbness in my left foot/big toe. Just desperate for advice. Thanks, Mike",

Years back I fell and fractured my spine. Good news; modern medicine was able to put me back together again but the bad news is I have residual pain which is 8/10 at best most of the time. Anyway, this message board is to tell you about things that have helped me with my pain, I will elaborate and I hope some of the things help you guys. First one is the toughest, I've learned to reduce the amount of stress in my life much as possible, everyone knows STRESS, specially when your confronted with it always makes the pain uncontrollable. I was able to stop working ( I realize this isn't possible for everyone) but if you can, stop. Then focus on things in your life that make you happy and do them on your schedule. Also, I've tried almost every modality available and the ones that helped me were, Nueromuscular Massage Therapy ( Myofacial Release), self hypnosis, listening to my favorite music ( my music isn't relaxing but I find it gets me to sleep), a really good bed ( tried them all and found the ""Sleep Number"" worked the best for me). Getting to realize your capabilities and learn to ask for help or do it yourself. I've found doing things myself again builds good cognitive awareness. Ice over heat. TENS, is a good distraction and sometimes it helps. I really have more but it feels like I'm writing a book so I'll stop here. Lastly, I want to point out medications I ended up taking after many years of hard opiates ( that's a whole story within itself).  I've found that Gabapentin, Klonopin, Lidocaine Patches, Vitamin D with Folic Acid, Wellbutrin ( for the depression) Celebrex are the major pills I take everyday. So check with your doctor.

I have been on controlled medication for 12 years. I take my medication faithfully (I can’t emphasize enough on the word faithfully) I take 2 medications for sleep; Ambien CR 12.5mg every night and Clonazepam 0.5mg x1 every night and 1 medication for pain Oxycodone 10/325mg x4. This has worked best for me for 12 years. I’m not 100% pain free maybe more like 80%. I wouldn’t be able to function if I didn’t take it. I follow all the rules of my controlled Drug Agreement my doctor had me sign. I see my Dr every 4 months for my Fibromyalgia as instructed. I am a good patient. Then it all changed in a blink of an eye. And all it took was a new doctor and a faulty Drug Test or maybe human error on the lab/doctors part or one other possible thought is I’ve been on a herbal supplement for a month and a half, however I told the nurse when I got tested I have this in my system. A false Negative was my result. I’m very upset and afraid of the outcome. I can’t say for sure if the new doctor that is taking over my doctor’s office wants to get rid of Chronic Pain patients or if there was truly a mistake with the drug test I took. I fault like heck to get the doctor on the phone because this test is absolutely without a doubt wrong. In my opinion, a person accused of not having the medication in there system when they do take it, is worse than a false positive. If I were to have a positive the doctor would say your done and give me a months’ worth of medication and a weaning schedule as per My Controlled Drug Agreement. But no its worse because I take the medication and because the drugscan lab gave me wrong results I will not be able to get a month of medication because the dr assumes it’s not in my system. I am scared to death. Have you ever read about Clonazepam withdrawal when done abruptly? It can be deadly it can cause a seizure that I may not be able to come out of. I just read this a few days ago while trying to figure out how to come off of 3 different medications. I fortunately had 1 refill of 30 left on the Clonazepam, Except I don’t know how to taper. I told the nurse who called me I need to know how to withdraw from all these medications her smart remark was you don’t need to know because it’s not in your system. I cried it is in my system I take it every day I swear to you. Im not lying. She didn’t care. What do I do? I don’t even know where to begin to wean off my medicines. I only have a few Ambien left and a few weeks of oxycodone left. I figure id start to come off the least medicine first which is Ambien CR. Its been 2 days off and last night I woke up with brain zaps at 2am. Couldn’t go back to sleep because of it. It was a creepy feeling I could only feel it when I laid down once I was up it went away. I sent a letter out fax and certified to the dr on Thursday asking him to help me wean down. And that his drug test is wrong. I need his help. He hasn’t called me back. I also sent a certified letter to Drugscan lab. What can I do? Can I get a lawyer?

When I was younger, I just thought they were growing pains, so I never paid attention to them. When I get the pain, it’s usually just in one leg or arm, either side of my body, from the uppermost joint (shoulder/hip) to the extremity (fingers/toes). Each pain lasts anywhere from 3 hours to 2 days; it’s not a shooting pain or an achy soreness, more of a dull pain that doesn’t go away with ice/heat/rest/exercise/pain medicine. It never inhibits me from moving or walking – the pain is normally about a 5 out of 10 when I’m resting, without applying pressure. With pressure/walking, it might increase to a 7 or 8 out of 10, but never more than that. It happens year-round, when I’m at my most active – playing a contact sport 6 day a week for months – and at my least active – doing no exercise for months at a time. For the past 6 months, I’ve kept track of the pains and I’ve noticed that they generally come in 2-week intervals. For example, I’ll experience a pain in my right leg one day, then two days later it’ll be a pain in my left arm, then the next day a pain in my left leg. Then, I’ll be pain-free for 12-16 days and the same thing will occur again. The intervals of pain will typically be 5-10 days, consisting of 3-5 incidents of pain, followed by two pain-free weeks.  I’ve seen an orthopedist, rheumatologist, and currently a neurologist, none of whom have been able to change anything, and my blood tests and enzyme tests have come up normal. They’ve ruled out lyme, rheumatoid arthritis, all myalgias. Was on a Vitamin D Rx for two months, that ended a month ago.  Have had a history of irregular periods, where I went from having a period every day for six months, to taking Junel Fe birth control pills to regulate my periods. Now I don’t get a period since I’m on the pill (for the past year). I’m scheduled for an EMG test next month.  Does anyone experience anything similar? Have any words of advice?",Chronic Pain

Have had my share of ups and downs, but haven't been in actual crisis for many years. This time, everything we (my treatment team and I) did made it worse instead of better. Med increase? More depressive thoughts. Lockdown? Higher anxiety. Intensive therapy? Severe anxiety with cardiac symptoms and all night night terrors. Nothing in our arsenal (and we are by no means armatures at treatment) seemed to work. Until a happenstance incident last evening. My husband and I both landed in the ER for food borne illness. We'll know in a few days if it was listeria or E. coli when the cultures come back. I was the worse off of us two, so I received a run of the mill penicillin/phenergan injection and oral antibiotics to follow up with at home. My husband received only oral meds as his symptoms weren't as severe. I had zero nightmares last night. Slept soundly, without tossing and turning all night. And awoke this morning to zero racing or negative thoughts, a positive outlook on life, and laughed so genuinely that I about fell out of my recliner which in turn made my husband laugh too. The point? Crisis over. Am I cured? No. I will always be on meds, under doctor's care and in therapy. However, could ther be an honest link between bacterial load and crisis? It's way above my pay grade to decide. But just for a moment imagine a simple blood test, an antibiotic injection and a day or two stay for said injection to do its job and return to life. Crisis over. Could it be? Or was it just a fluke incident? The results are very real, but the why's are not as clear. Please, anyone, everyone, hopefully doctors and researchers, read this and look further into it. It is Sunday, however you can bet your bottom dollar I will light up the phone lines tomorrow to my treatment team to get them in on it.

Nothing really shows up on scans to indicate something is in there but I always feel like I have to put pressure on it for some reason. I've even gone so far as to have someone take a vice-wrench or whatever it's called to clamp down as hard as they could as deeply and as far into my shoulder blade as possible but that has only caused lack of feeling on the surface and the internal pain is getting worse.

What I've seen over the years is that all pain is either caused by or contributed to by inflammation in the body. And much of the inflammation we accumulate is from things we do on a daily basis, such at eating. All of my clients with pain issues, migraines, chronic headaches, etc have experienced relief by identifying the foods they react to which contribute to their inflammation. If you feel that you might be reacting to food (often accompanied by bloating, digestive issues in addition to pain)","Knee Pain , Chronic Pain , Headaches , Hip Pain , Migraines , Back Pain"

While I cannot confirm when my depression started I know I most defiantly have it now. All I remember is as a child I never smiled and never hung out with friends, and was constantly bullied. I never once sought help for this, and nobody even bothered to notice. not family or the ""friends"" I had at school. In recent years my depression has gotten worse. I am finding myself struggling to even take care of myself now. I constantly lock myself in my room, only forcing myself to get up and eat, bathe, and use the restroom. I barely hang out or talk to my family. I dropped out of collage because I felt I was being Judged and that my depression was getting bad. I would constantly look over my shoulder and always made sure to avoid eye contact for longer than a few seconds with anybody. I hate talking about my feeling with my family even thought my mom and sister constantly give me the option. I know if I tell them they would blame themselves for not realizing how bad I was feeling. I don't know what to do anymore. I have always dreamed of owning and running my own animal rescue, however I know as of now I can't even begin to achieve my dream. How can I take care of animals If I can't even take care of myself. I don't know what to do anymore. While I am no-longer harming myself and thinking of suicide, all I want to do now is sleep, my dreams are the only way I can escape reality. There are some days I think of picking up my blade again, but I choose not to. I fear one day I will once again. I think It's time I find help, but because I'm Antisocial and reclusive I cant bring myself to meet people or talk to a therapist.","Depression , Self Harm , Bipolar Disorder , Personality Disorders"

As I begin to drift off to sleep I experience what can best be described as a head rush, a quick, intense rush of blood or energy, I'm not sure which, to the head. Needless to say this is very disturbing, it's like having someone jolt me awake right as I'm falling asleep. This causes my heart to race and makes it almost impossible to fall asleep. This doesn't happen every night, it comes in phases where it will happen frequently for a few weeks and then go away for a while but it always comes back. Has anyone ever heard of such a thing?",

It started with extreme itching all over my legs. Later, I am itchy pretty much everywhere. I never had any sign of a rash, or allergic reaction. Sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the night from scratching.( I have no known allergies )  First Steps:  Doctor: I first started by changing the detergent I was using. Then, I went to the doctor who ran blood tests, stool samples, urine tests, and everything came back normal. In the mean time, she suggested I take an anti-histamine for relief and sent me off to get an allergy test. I went to get a full comprehensive allergy test - everything came back normal. However, I hadn't stopped taking the anti-histamine as I was not advised to so I am unsure if it could have been a false test as a result. She then referred me to a dermatologist Dermatologist: I went to the dermatologist, and after describing my symptoms, he did not inspect my skin, but he advised that I do a scabies treatment. (Neither my partner nor I have any signs of scabies and we live together ) I went ahead and did the treatment regardless. Itching persisted. I went back for a follow up, and he suggested that I do it again - out of frustration I asked him, if it wasn't scabies what we would be trying next and he said we would start blood tests etc over. Needless to say I did not go back to him. Doctor: I went back to the doctor to explain my frustrations, and hope for an alternative solution to my problem. She prescribed me steroid creams to try, but it was difficult as the itching was not localized. She advised that this could be something environmental that I never find out - which wasn't something I was willing to accept. This condition has been making me extremely irritable and has begun to affect my professional and personal life. Naturopath: At this point, I've turned to a naturopath. Over the last 6 months, I feel like we have tried almost everything. She reviewed my blood work, and did a new stool sample to rule out parisites. My symptoms now include: itching everywhere, including the bottoms of my feet until they peel and get hot. Itching my legs until they scab. Dry stinging chest, itchy eyes. Painful sweating and itching in areas where there is pressure from clothing ie; waistband, bra straps. Clamy hot skin waist band, bra, underwear lines. More comfortable in loose fitting clothes. Sensitive skin to the point where any fabric ( sheets on my bed included ) touches me, and its almost a painful sensation, prickly burning. This is a list of the following things we have done to try and treat the condition: 1. Mastocytosis Disease - low histamine diet & Stinging Nettle Tea, Quercetin SAP. 2. Low histamine diet, B12 injections, & NAC SAP Antioxidant, Cyto-Calm to help with my sleepless nights. 3. Liver Cleanse - Live SAP & Chelidonium Plex drops 4. Parasite Cleanse - Garlic Activated Principles, Berber, Black Walnut, OIl of Oregano 5. Going off birth control (Nueva Ring) - I was on Yasmine from age 16 - 20, went on Seasonale for about 1 year - went off the pill for 4 months - went back on to yasmine for about 1 year - swtiched to Nueva Ring, on it for approx. 6months) She has given me Femco & Chaste tree to help with the symptoms.  I have been off the Nueva ring for about 1.5 months now. I got my first period normal timing. Since then, my symptoms have increased, and I have scabs all over my shins, now starting to my thighs from itching my skin so hard. Symptoms seem to be worse with clothing on. At work I get hot flash symptoms. I have been consistently waking up at 3am and having trouble falling asleep for the last 3-4 months now. Often wake up in a cold sweat. When I exercise, and sweat my scalp becomes incredibly itchy almost stinging sensation.  My libido is non-existant, and the irritability from itching doesn't help.

I went to CPS for a long time. When they moved here to KY they weren't all set up. I gave urine and left it in the bathroom with other samples. The next thing I knew I was being discharged because she said I tested positive for meth. I honestly don't know who's urine git mixed up with mine but I don't do meth or any other recreational drugs. I tried to get her to take a hair or whatever she needed but she was dead set on discharging me. I told her I was 54 years old and if I wanted to do meth I would but I wouldn't be stupid enough to give a urine sample if I did it. It's been 3 years since I've been there and I feel like they should take me back. I didn't get to talk to Dr Kroll at all about the situation. I was treated very unfair. I really liked CPS until they did that to me. It was a bare face lie. I would like to come back to the clinic and I don't think it's fair that they punish someone that is innocent.

After antibiotics for 15 days I started getting really dizzy. The earache cleared up but the dizziness didn't. I went on prednisone to help with the dizziness but it didn't work. Jan 17 (first week) started with a horrible headache. The dizziness eventually subsided but the headache has stayed now for a little over 2 months. It is mostly, if not exclusively, right sided only. It sits in my right temple. I also have allodynia (per my neuro) in my right temple. I suffered a 3 month chronic headache in 2016 (Mar-May) that finally broke and no headache until now. I had an MRI at THAT time (May 16) all was clear. I have not had an MRI this time. I am going on the 15th. I am so worried. This headache is terrible constant dull ache in my right temple, pain and burning in the right temple, also sometimes little stabs of pain. I thought the headache was getting better with massage and chiro and then it just started back again. I have ALOT of muscle tension and soreness in my neck. I thought this was the cause. The massage isn't really helping. The chiro isn't really helping.  Right after I thought the headache was getting better, now it is coming on with a burning all over my head on top of the right temple pain. I feel disoriented, tired and just REALLY worried. The headache doesn't respond to Advil or Aleve. I can't say what makes it worse or better.

My grandfather developed a very severe case after undergoing surgery for a badly broken arm. His toes are extremely bad and he is in constant pain; any type of pain relief is temporary and he is up most of the nights unable to sleep.  He has seen a couple specialists and they have recommended below the knee amputation. They said there is no guarantee that this will get rid of the pain. If he does not amputate, the progression will be intense and he will likely die within weeks. My grandfather is very discouraged and highly resistant to any amputation. He has expressed wanting to give up fighting because the pain is so endless. My family is heartbroken and don't know where to turn. We want to make sure he explores all options before making a decision that will impact his life. Any experience with factors that predict success with amputation for blue toe?

So I was told that his sons mother is talking about taking me off of the hospital visiting list, because she's upset at the relationship we had. So I guess my question is.. is that possible? If they were never married? And we already have to go to the precinct to get paperwork every single day that we want to see him that states in his sister, because he was arrested because of problems that occurred during the accident. So that makes it incredibly difficult to see him besides having my own child that I have no help caring for. I can only really see him during school hours and it's never enough time and I just keep trying to understand how people function daily when a loved one is in this condition going through these circumstances and drama. I can barely function I just want to be with him and do right by him cause I know if he had a say in anything he'd want me to be the one staying with him every night but as of now and probably a long time he won't have a say in much, I honestly don't know whether I'm right or wrong .. if I should be visiting every day or calm down and visit every other day maybe? last I heard they were going to try and wake him up 72 hours after the surgery but he woke up himself a little before then and they said that he was basically in stable condition. He has a breathing tube and he's very sedated. I'd like to believe he hears me and knows I'm there. Whenever I'm there visiting since he's “woken” his eyes are still dazed but I feel as if they move to where I'm speaking. when I talk to him and tell him I'm leaving he occasionally lifts his arm or starts jumping a little, it's scary but it's usually right when I'm telling him I'll see him later and leave him, and then when I tell him to calm down he does. Does anyone have any advice anything positive that they know about injuries like this and also realistic expectations to what I'll be dealing with in the next few months to a year. Is there even a possibility with the little info I gave you to tell me whether or not there's a chance I'll speak to him again where he'll understand or be able to communicate back? Any info on traumatic brain injury? I would love any positivity but obviously realistic expectations are welcomed too!","Knee Pain , Chronic Pain , Headaches , Neck Pain , Physical Therapy , Hip Pain , Medication , Migraines , Back Pain"

The traction bed system develops automatically approx. 5-10%) stretch force resulting from the redirected body weight. The fundamental advantage is the application on the patient without straps, weights, etc. in the horizontal placement. At first, the system was designed to stretch the spinal column. The passing years, however, revealed additional positive effects such as Widening of intervertebral spaces. Loosening of muscle tension by lasting distension of musculature and ligaments. Volumetric increase of disks, thereby lowering the pressure on nerve roots in prolapse cases or deformities. Possible repositioning of malaligned spinal segments or prolapse. Realignment of vertebral foramen leading to eleviation or elimination of nerve root compression resulting in possibly improved vascular clearance from the affected epidural and paravertebral venous reticula. More so this system is non-invasive and can be carried along everyway in order to relief your symptoms.","Chronic Pain , Medication , Migraines"

The Gp this time thought that it might be a situational muscle pain and there was nothing we can do about it? I dont understand this diagnosis my sons routine is fairly consistent so how can a muscle all of a sudden start to cause problems with no overt exercise or trigger? seeing my son in so much pain is heart breaking and I need to find an answer so that I can help him either to get the right medical attention or find a way of helping him manage this better. The only other piece of information I have is that the pain eases after a nights sleep and gets gradually worse gain throughout the day my son generally tends to reduce his food intake during this time can only manage about 1 meal a day.

My doctor also didn't inform me of this NSAID complication. I had taken 1 tablet aspirin about 15 minutes before I applied the Flector patch.

However, last night I've had the worst time falling asleep ever and it is currently 7 o'clock in the morning and I've literally not been to sleep. I lay in bed until about 4ish and then gave up. However, I don't feel as tired as I should for someone that hasn't slept all night? I am so annoyed because I've had such a good week of good sleep. I really don't understand what is going on with me and why this has suddenly began happening?

I played volleyball through college and have surfed my whole life. On top of that I work out and used to practice martial arts. All in all, I was always active and always in shape. Now, I can hardly do any of the activities I used to enjoy. My back hurts so bad I can't play volleyball or most sports. My knees have started to ache which makes it difficult to surf and I have shooting pain from my shoulder to my wrist which makes it hard to do just about anything that requires hands. My back pain started 2 years ago, I was playing basketball and I turned for a pass and something happened. I can't recall if it was a pop or what, but it was definitely something that initiated the pain. From my research and countless doctors it appears to be a psoas injury. However, 2 years of stretching, icing, physical therapy, massage therapy and chiropractors have yielded NO results. I'm not nearly active as I was and yet my body keeps getting worse. My back hurts the worst now a days when I drive. If I drive for more then 20 minutes without having a bunch of pillows to sit on the pain quickly becomes unbearable. It also hurts really bad spiking in volleyball, something about the torque like movement on my lower left back or psoas or whatever it is. On top of that I've started to recently experience knee pain which hurts walking, running, biking, surfing, etc...it's been on going for about 3 months. I stretch every day for all the muscles around the knee and have surfed a LOT less than normal, but to no avail. My shoulder pain has been on and off for probably 5 years, I understand this is probably due to volleyball and probably some kind of nerve thing but my doctor said it's tennis elbow and to buy a brace which I think they pulled out of nowhere. Recently this has been getting far worse. My shoulder hurts, my wrist hurts my hand hurts and my elbow hurts worst of all. Very sharp pain that I can push through but extreme discomfort. I have no idea what's going on. I'm 5'10 about 170 lbs with very very low body fat. I'm in shape still as I still workout and exercise when I'm not in too much pain. I've had injuries before and strained muscles but these are way longer and persistent than anything I've experienced. I'm open to ANY advice you might have, I will be trying accupuncture soon, next step will be some voodoo doctors from Madagascar (not really, but I'm getting desperate).  Thank you in advance and if there is any more info that would help you advise me, don't hesitate to ask.","Knee Pain , Chronic Pain , Neck Pain , Back Pain"

For several years I have experienced recurring pain in my lower right side. When it starts to flare up, it feels like a muscle cramp that makes it hurt to breathe and move in certain directions. It does hurt when I press the area. In the past, this pain would happen randomly, perhaps once every few months. I would be sitting and try to stand and feel the tug and pain. It would typically go away within 30 minutes to an hour. Recently, I've noticed the pain takes longer to fade. January 1 of this year I went to the hospital because I couldn't lie down (pain so intense but only when I would attempt the sleeping position. Literally did not affect me at work when I would walk around etc, only pain upon sitting, standing up, bending over to tie my shoe, trying to lie down, and sometimes taking a deep breath). After two nights of trying to sleep upright on the couch, I caved and went to get it checked out. Doctors did an ultrasound of my ovaries (thinking it was a cyst) and abdominal region but did not notice anything. They sent me home and said it was not an emergency, prescribed me some pain killers and said it could be a small hernia.  I'm now having a flare up again. It started this morning after breakfast.

I was a happy child, until changes around 8/9 years happened and my mom had stepfather, after stepfather after stepfather, I guess all she wanted was a family she never had while growing up, and after she lost her husband at age 33, hat dream was squashed, so she met my dad 5 years later I was born, it was an abusive relationship, he never worked, he was a ""man about town"", so they say, so my mom hid the truth of who my real father was, until I was around 10/11 my older sister, in a not so nice way, as I was the last one, I was also the favourite, and she told me all the characteristics of my dad, they were 4 from my mom's marriage, and they never warmed up to me, like me the way the last born child is normally liked in the family, so while growing up, along with the stain of being sexually molested by 3 men around 8/9 when the changes in my life took place, that never helped my esteem at all, so I became quieter and quieter and even failed subjects at school which required thinking i.e. mathematics, my mom never knew that the men she exposed me to, molested me also, I had no way of telling her, at the time, she was busy trying to be a ""wife"" or girlfriend and was also trying to be a mom to us, and she never could do a good job, as her own mom, wasn't there for her - right now im 37 and my mom is 75 and we have a good relationship - I once read somewhere, that ""the day a child becomes an adult, is the day he/she learns to forgive his/her parent"", I did, it wasn't easy, to get over the rejection of the world, being changed from house to house as some of my mom's boyfriends wanted only her, and not children, at some point in our lives, she chose the men over us, but it was a mistake, and everyone makes mistakes, no matter the degree, what is important is acknowledging it and learning from it - she later had a masters degree at the age of 55 and I have the utmost of respect for her, so we stopped seeing step fathers, after my middle school years, around 12/13 - but then my brother was the troublesome one at home and acted out a lot - drinking, breaking windows, jails, dropping of jail charges, our house was already known at the police station, my mom blamed herself, just like she blamed herself when I started smoking marijuana at the age of 22, I was diagnosed with bipolar and depression, after a suicide attempt and loss of reality, it was a scary period in my life and I acted out all those suppressed feelings and even one day hit my own mother, we got past that, I got therapy, for almost 10 years I saw one psychologist and psychiatrist - my siblings said I wanted ""attention"" so none of them ever came to visit me in hospital during any of my yearly depressive relapses, but I have them to thank for being the strong woman I am, I changed schools 5 times in my life, I have slept with more than a 100 men, out of acting out, I was so destructive, I tried suicide a couple of times, only to fail and one day I fell pregnant, at 27, and I gave birth to a baby boy-my current joy and light-although, at the time, I had post natal depression for almost two years and had no maternal insticts, my child was a product of my promiscuity and acting out, I look back now, everything happens for a reason, im in a 5 year marriage now, my son gets along so well with his stepfather, the first man to ever know what I faced in my life, he taught me to trust and respect a man, he is my friend, my confidante, like my mom and my son, my son makes me laugh so much through his over-active imagination - my problem is I want to stop smoking marijuana but I am so scared to live without it-it has been my source of comfort or balance for a long time and I feel now its becoming a burden more and more and am starting to hate it because my son is 11, and he knows and I feel so dirty, sort of not clean in my son's eyes, even though him and I have spoken about it - I feel I need to do right by him - I don't want him to get addicted to something else later in life in order to cope with life's stages, like my mom's mom used alcohol, my mom used men, I used men and marihuana - I live a double life and I have no one to tell this to, atleast someone who can look at me without judging me, I need help, a pillar, someone who can help get ovwer this thing, its controlling my life and has come to a point whereby I hate it - the sad part is, my partner also smokes, and its wrong, please help me, anyone?im not making excuses by telling my story, its better to know the core of the problem than to solve it, background assists, so in a way, im telling my story seeking to find other people who might be going through the same thing - or has in the past - I am no longer a sexual abuse victim, im a survivor, but now I need to be a survivor from substance - I don't want to use it anymore but I cant do without it at the same time, I am in between a rock and a hard place - but deep down, I can fast forward a couple of years and see myself, drug-free - oh how I crave for that period - it will take me working harder, I need the strength and encouragement. It really wasn't easy to disclose this, when you see me, im an orderly person, hard working, can keep a job, I don't have qualifications as yet but im getting there being a late bloomer, but I cannot register for school while smoking pot, please someone assist me - I would really appreciate the support - this drug is and has taken over a huge part of my life and I cant even find someone to trust and confide in because I am ashamed, I don't look like I am an addict, but I am, I am speaking to other addicts, or other people who have managed to overcome it, and im saying I have a problem. I can manage my bipolar, I am and have been on treatment, and its in remission and I have taken years to educate myself, because my only support system was my mom, my two doctors, friends I had, I no longer have, because I befriended them for the wrong reasons, to belong, to hide behind their shadow, now I have evolved, I still have trust issues, I can make friends but I always knew that after my past, I will always be a somewhat sensitive being, and that makes me a good friend and a good partner and parent - I just battle with this addiction - when the daily pressures are done with, before I get to bed, I have to smoke to relax and shut down my mind...and I don't want to do that anymore.","Anxiety & Panic Disorders , Abuse Victims , Depression , Self Harm , Substance Abuse , Bipolar Disorder"

I felt more welcome posting here.","Seems a conflict of interest to state an overwhelming care for a patients pain and back it up with uninformative lists of studies. Sure the number of deaths of 'elicit' opioid prescriptions are claim made time and again, but pointing out the connection falls short of any real study as the reader is left to make their own conclusions. More to the crux would have been to show that deaths continue to be on the rise despite the remedial work in arrests and sanctions against companies started years before the studies....an indication that more is afoot then over prescribing and the reluctance to turn the reader toward real issues when heroin and fentanyl are used interchangeably with oxycodone. There are also abstentions from using MS Contin as a medication in these studies as a safer alternative, yet ms contin is vilified with the others as a culprit in the many deaths in the US. A similar vagueness seems to corner the use of these medications (not without their risks, but should have a clean delineation for their lack of use in ending a life by choice or overdose, but more due more to drug abuse). I see a vast disconnect from sending patients from hospitals with a great habit when used in conjunction to reduce pain to manageable levels. I just don't see how the argument is made other then by forcing the issue as in every other sense by use of rehashing information with so little an appeal to reason that, well (I for one cannot see the attachment of a relevant provocation other then begging the reader to forbear the eventuality of common sense appeal, that is not achieved. In other areas of the ""Pain Doctor"" the positive, upbeat provisions to resolve pain are so basic, that anyone worth their salt would have already tried for their issues.","Chronic Pain , Back Pain"

I fell on my left knee last October (2016) and ever since I have been experiencing stabbing pain in that knee usually just when I step up a stair with my left leg first (I'm working on not doing that anymore). Also it happens sometimes when I turn my left leg while keeping my foot straight. Several weeks ago, I was at a friend's house in his studio basement, and when I went up the stairs to grab some coffee (late night recording session) I got this stabbing pain in my left knee so bad I couldn't make it up the stairs! I did find that if I stepped on the next step, with my left foot pointed way outward (think Charlie Chaplain, with just the left foot), I was able to go up the stairs without the pain. I tried putting my foot on the stair normally and stabbing pain again. Turn left foot outward as much as possible, step up, no pain? All of this has been explained numerous times to my Primary and the Orthopedists, but they seem to just tune that incident on the stairs out as a fluke that means nothing to their diagnosis... which as of today, they have none.   The Drs and Orthopedists have taken several X-Rays of my knee. Other than a bone spur on the inside of my left knee cap (pointing towards my cartilage), which they think would not be causing me this pain they cannot find anything. I have recently underwent an MRI and I am waiting to see the Dr for the results on Tuesday (5/30/17). I'm not hopeful that they are capable of figuring this out. Do these symptoms sound like anything someone here has had before? If so, did you get a definitive diagnosis? If so, what was it? Also, do you think I can convince the Medical Gods that mere mortals like you and I might have come upon something that the infallible Medical Gods had missed?

My doctor has told me that she thinks I have pleurisy. However, I feel that if it was pleurisy I still wouldn't have a lingering discomfort. The pain is definitely better but it seems like it won't completely go away. This pain also causes me to have a shortness of breath. I took like 2 hits of cannabis a week ago, but I haven't since then. Could that be the cause of it still lingering? I am just worried and I feel like my doctor is misdiagnosing me.

I was in a meeting in a conference room which was a little cool, around 65 degrees. I was wearing snug but comfortable sneakers. After sitting for about 2 hours, we took a break, I stepped outside for a smoke and started feeling a painful itching sensation in my left little toe on the way back to the conference room. The meeting lasted about another 1.5 hours and the sensation seemed to get a little worse over that time. After the meeting, I started to feel it worsen dramatically as I was walking. Upon arriving home and removing shoes and socks, I noticed that the toe was swollen and red. There was no blister evident at that time. Today in the shower I cleaned and massaged it slightly, feeling no pain while doing that. Afterwards the pain and redness returned. Throughout my day I did walk a bit, and by the time I was on my way home I was almost in tears with the pain. My walk has turned into an extreme limp, but I can still hobble around by favoring the inside of my foot. When I removed my footwear this evening, I realized that the swelling was extreme, it has become very painful to the touch, and there is a purple-ish blister in the crack on the underside of the toe (see pic). The entire toe feels quite hard to the touch and it is now a constant shooting and unbearable pain which almost feels like the toe wants to burst. I have been taking OTC Naproxen Sodium throughout the day to counteract which does dull, but does not eliminate the pain. I realize that I am likely going to have to see a professional to have the problem diagnosed, however I am short Medical Coverage and not financially able to cover medical bills which will ensue. I am hoping for a little guidance towards possible diagnoses and home remedies that might help to ease the pain and hopefully cure the problem.

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/8302/23-years-old---scared-with-my-body-strange-arm-pain,23 years old - Scared with my body/ strange arm pain,"(Sorry for my bad english) I am 23 years old and my last two and a half months have been a horror movie - I had never had major health problems. I am writing this to vent and because it may be that someone has suggestions on what to do or what's happening (if you bother to read this will) ... At the beginning of March I had a ""wrick"" feeling on my back as I swept my room. At that moment I did not cared that much and I continued to clean the house ... I had already had one or another situation like that and as it always was resolved quickly, I did not bother ... For some years before, I was having mild pain in that same low back when I was sitting for some time In the same position, in walking, stopping and walking again, etc. But nothing that worsened my quality of life, so I always ignored. In fact, on the same day of the ""wrick"", I ended up doing (stupidly) also a giant walk, in a course full of ascents and descents. I continued to make efforts, carrying loads of shopping, traveling bags and backpacks (as I have always done since I studied at university, often stupidly ignoring buses and making unnecessary efforts) ... Until a couple of weeks after that ""wrick"", with the lumbar spine constantly sore, I felt pain radiating from my legs as I rose from the table after supper. I was scared and went to the hospital the next day. They dispatched me with painkillers and anti-inflammatories that I could barely take because they were causing me dizziness and tummy aches. I decided to go to a neurosurgeon who prescribed new medication (two painkillers, a stomach protection and a small dose of injectable cortisone) and asked me to do an MRI scan of the lumbar spine. As a result, the L5-SI disc was somewhat dehydrated and had a small herniation / protrusion touching the sciatic nerve, everything else was normal. The doctor said it was nothing special, that I might have occasional pains from now on, but that in time, after this accute phase, Ishould stay close to the state I was before this incident. He told me to avoid weights, bad postures and wait during some time. In this consultation I also complained of a feeling of pressure in the left arm (I was only able to subside this sensation if I pressed/made strength in the fist) that I started to have when taking the medication, but he did not care ... However, this sensation of pressure became a sensation of constant burning through the left arm (especially between the wrist and the elbow, the focus of pain sometimes moves to the lower arm, shoulder... it changes from time to time). Then the right arm joined the party, although this one only gives me intermittent. I do not feel any weakness, the pain is indifferent to the activity or resting of the arms. In the middle I began to experience facial and cervical pains due to temporomandibular dysfunction - the two discs of the joint go where they should not. I went to a specialist who made sure to reassure me after palpation and said that it is banal, that it is only due to dental malocclusion - she's almost sure using braces or a drip will solve the problem, I'm about to go to a doctor for that ... Due to the persistent pain in the left arm and the pain in the lumbar and legs not evolving, I decided to return to the neurosurgeon and to visit another one to have a second opinion (this one also did not find my magnetic resonance to the lumbar to be anything that serious) and he asked me to to perform an electromyography in order to detect irradiated cervical lesions to the arms, nervous system problems and an early degenerative tendency of multiple discs of the spine. Result: everything normal. Both doctors agreed to take a drug called Lyrica (for neuropathic pain) for a month to see if the arm improved. In relation to the lumbar, they say to wait a few more months because it is likely to improve - although they emphasize that there is always a chance of being operated on later. This post should be as chaotic as my body is, but I informed the doctors of all the problems, how and when they came up, etc ... including the question of the jaw. By normal electromyography, illnesses such as multiple sclerosis have likely been ruled out ... I am going to have a resonance also to the cervical, although by electromyography it should be okay in this part of the back, acorrding to the doctors. I do not understand what's going on and I'm so afraid it's something systemic or immune like I am to simply stick with these pains, like that, forever. I'm starting to get desperate, it's been more than two months since it all started ... And I do not understand what the hell is going on with my arms. If it could be circulation, bones (rheumatism / arthritis, I already had a fracture in the arm, another in the wrist and another in the left hand when I was younger), muscles ... I do not know which experts to go, I do not know anything! It's scary and disturbing that it's all happening at the same time ...","Chronic Pain , Neck Pain , Back Pain"

Three months has passed and I had the attack. I thought it happened because of the scoliosis, but apparently the doctor said scoliosis will not give me those symptoms.

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/10960/chronic-pain,Chronic Pain,"I too am one of a million people suffering from chronic pain. There has been much in the media about the opiate crisis. Since I am under a pain management doctor's care and take opiates for chronic pain, I am very concerned. The media states how many people are dying each day from opiate overdoses, but I never hear about how many people, under a pain management doctor's care are dying from overdoses. I take my meds as prescribed and I take them for my pain, not to get high. I have been taking opiates for the past 11 years.  I live in Florida which has some of the strictest laws covering opiate prescriptions. For a time after restrictions were put in place, finding a pharmacy to fill your Rx was difficult. Many pharmacies were afraid to fill narcotics or the pharmacy would be out of the meds due to DEA allowing pharmacies to carry only a certain amount of the drugs.  There are many judgmental people, both in and out of the medical community believing chronic pain suffers do not need pain medication. I have had physical therapy, TENS unit, steroid injections, talk therapy, support groups, every over the counter pain aid on the market and finally a 12 hour reconstructive surgery on my cervical and thoracic spine. The surgery failed and pain continued. Pain medications help me tremendously, but they are not a cure all, I still have pain. I am thankful for my life, and pain medications help me live a good life. Without pain meds, I don't know how I could endure agonizing pain day after day without any relief.","Chronic Pain , Neck Pain , Medication , Back Pain"

She had gotten weaned off the vent and was paralyzed on left side. She had trouble finding the right word to use when speaking. For instance, if she wanted to say ""911"" shed say "" fire station"" or "" doctor"". She has now had another massive stroke this time affecting the left side of the brain. She is unresponsive and constantly sticks out her lips and tongue. She doesn't seem to react to pain or fright, doesn't follow commands but can move both eyes. She stares at the ceiling lights or EKG machine. Echo cardio came back good and only went into afib once since stay. There's a small bleed so they stopped blood thinners. Eeg showed decreased brain waves. Neuro says 1/3 damage to each side of brain although right side was previously told 1/4.She does move her left arm and very small movement in right arm.when run pen under right food she moves it. She's had pneumonia which they say has went away but one of the blood samples they took showed infection so waiting on updated blood test result. She's had light blood in urine and stool. Neuro says she'll be vegetable and most doctors tell me just to make her comfortable. Is it wrong to give her some time, like we did we did with first stroke to see if she improves?

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/1546/to-all-posting-here-with-chronic-pain,TO ALL POSTING HERE WITH CHRONIC PAIN,"I decided to write one post that should be relevant to most people who post here with questions. The members and/or health experts in the WebMD message boards can not provide any type of medical advice or diagnosis. The best thing to do is if you have chronic pain is to discuss this with your primary doctor first, who may recommend an appropriate specialist to treat your condition. We can share what has worked for us and details about our own conditions, but can not advise you what you should do to relief your pain other than see your doctor. Once you have seen your doctor or doctor(s), then you can come back and post some specific questions that we may be able to answer. I have been managing moderate to severe chronic pain for over 40 years - since my late teens. I was born with a spinal defect called hyperkyphosis, which is where the middle (thoracic) section of my spine is curved outward too much. I have severe osteoarthritis in my spine and entire body and had to have both hips replaced last year (right in June and left in November) and am thrilled with those results. I have stenosis at all levels, a total of 8 herniated discs, DDD with some discs completely gone, bone spurs at each level of my spine and my vertebrae T12 and L1 are lying against each other on their sides with a broad based herniated disc between them.. I had to stop working at age 51, applied for SSD and was approved in 2 months due to the solid medical evidence. I do what I can to help in and around the house, but do spend a lot of time in my recliner. I am allergic to all opiate pain medication so can only take muscle relaxers and enteric coated aspirin. I have seen probably dozens of various spine specialists and all say that there is no surgery that could help me. I've tried steroid injections and rhizotomies (ablations) but the results are temporary - 6 months at the most - and symptoms return worse than before. I get a chiropractic adjustment about once per month and two neurosurgeons have told me that they are helping to keep me out of a wheel chair right now. I share all this to say that when I reply in a post that I understand, I truly do and live with this daily. I rely mostly on my faith and family to help me focus on the blessings that are in my life.

Before I had the surgery I received an epidural steroid injection. It did nothing for the pain I was experiencing. It was all sciatica and it was debilitating. I should have never been given the shot because my condition was so bad it required surgery to relieve the pain. The neurosurgeon performed my surgery in a surgery center about 3 weeks after the ESI. The procedure took about 4 hours and I was sent home the same day. The following day I woke up I was screaming in pain from not only my back but also my arm, specifically my right shoulder. The nurse called to check on me and when I asked what was done to my arm she said the Dr ordered a 120mg shot of Depo Medrol. I have a huge dent in my shoulder, complete muscle atrophy. I have had serious depression, massive weight gain, uncontrollable sweating and awful, awful pain throughout my entire body. I was told by my GP that my Divot will be permanent . What I haven't been told is WHY was a shot of Deep Medrol given to me directly into my deltoid muscle. Is this standard? I have been searching for weeks and can't find a single incident of a patient given such a high dose of steroid into the shoulder while undergoing open back surgery. I was never informed that I was going to be receiving this shot and I was NEVER told that it was administered until I asked. I have had almost every single adverse reaction possible. My surgeon only saw me 10 days after surgery to remove stitches. I guess $450,000 in fees isn't enough to get a straight answer as to why this was done to me. I would have never agreed!!!! I would like to hear of the possible reasons this was administered to me. I have already come to realize that it should never be given in the deltoid due to it's high probability of causing muscle atrophy especially when not administered properly.

I have noticed that the physicians at the Urgent Care locations in one particular county frequently (almost daily) call for ""stat"" D-dimer tests, whereas the physicians in the other counties do not call at all. I realize that they are using the test to help rule out thrombosis, but I question why some physicians are able to do so without ordering this test on a stat basis. From my previous experience in the commercial lab business, this is not a test included on their stat test menus because it is considered to be a test that should be ordered at a hospital. I am not ""clinical"" so it would not be considered appropriate for me to question a physician's practices. Does anyone have any insight on the different ordering patterns?",

I asked them to scan her brain they didn’t and they only put Diagnosis of coughing up blood - she complained of right leg Charlie horses and they did not even check for a blood clot! Symptoms List Summarized: -chest pain over a year now -at ER 2 nights ago she described it as a constant pain in her left upper side of her chest Coughed up blood clot 2 weeks ago -Fatigue -nose bleeds -Anxiety and Stress (she attributes to being from her job and some of it probably is) -Feels like it’s hard to swallow -she is always clearing her throat -recently I see her grabbing her neck more and more (universal sign for choking) -lack of balance -dry cough -feels like she is congested -coughed up almost a 1 inch blood clot less than 2 weeks ago -Charlie horse pains often in her right foot and lower leg (sign of DVT) -she described to me she “felt like there was a blood clot in her neck”  -she physically looks drained -she seems to know something is wrong -she is forgetting things she never should forget (she bought my baby an elephant and it’s head and ears flap - she was SO happy to show my baby this toy and less than ONE or TWO months later, she asked me who got it for my daughter!! I almost cried because I know something is wrong.) -today she was holding my daughter standing still and lost her balance and said “woah” this has happened more and more frequently! -severe constipation (thinks her bowels were impacted and couldn’t be go to bathroom for a week!) -dehydration -extremely thirsty *My Dad thinks her tripping is normal and I think he is blinding himself to it because he doesn’t pay enough attn or he thinks it’s normal and he said he forgets stuff sometime and loses balance but I can tell you for a fact he doesn’t and if he does it’s nothing like my Mom has been!  Detailed explanation and symptoms: I need help getting my Mom diagnosed and admitted to a hospital until they are 100% positive about her diagnosis.  My Mom has had chest pain for over 6 months, probably a year. She coughed up Blood 2 weeks ago and is not a smoker. In November, when I knew something was wrong; I told her to go the ER - I made her go quite honestly. They did an EKG, and said everything was fine and her heart looked good. I know she has a lung problem, thyroid problem and possibly a brain problem. I am positive because of handwriting analysis. I backed off for a while after her EKG was good because I was worrying her and my parents were both getting upset. She had mild and completely random - maybe once a week or once every two weeks - problems with her memory. She had random leg pain only in one leg and she didn’t know how to describe it. She had a minor and very little cough I think she has been hiding from me. In December, around Christmas, she was watching my baby and she said she reached for something behind the radio and pulled a muscle. I kept telling her to go make sure that was all it was and she just kept ignoring it. She had the pain to where at times I could tell it was bothering her and at times it hurt her to sit and feed my baby when she visited which really bugged me. This pain she had was in her upper left quadrant (near her ribs and she described it as basically from the front of the lower rib area to the back of the lower rib area). She never had it looked at! It hurt her for ATLEAST a month probably more like 2 months.  I have noticed her “tripping” or losing balance for the past 3-6 months but it is becoming more and more often. I said something to her almost every time I seen it happen and she brushes it off as if nothing happened. Well, it has got more and more frequent to the point I’m worried she will fall and really hurt herself or while holding my baby, fall and hurt my baby along with herself!! :(  Also, she told me just recently she has been having a lot more symptoms than I realized. I made her go to the ER last night with the following symptoms: -Coughed up blood clot 2 weeks ago -Fatigue -Anxiety and Stress (she attributes to being from her job and some of it probably is) -Feels like it’s hard to swallow -she is always clearing her throat -recently I see her grabbing her neck more and more (universal sign for choking) -lack of balance -dry cough -feels like she is congested -coughed up almost a 1 inch blood clot less than 2 weeks ago -Charlie horse pains often in her right foot and lower leg (sign of DVT) -she described to me she “felt like there was a blood clot in her neck”  -she physically looks drained -she seems to know something is wrong -she is forgetting things she never should forget (she bought my baby an elephant and it’s head and ears flap - she was SO happy to show my baby this toy and less than ONE or TWO months later, she asked me who got it for my daughter!! I almost cried because I know something is wrong. Her grandma had mini strokes often and her grandma and grandpa were both on blood thinners. Last night they gave her a contrast ct of her chest, blood work and d-dimer and told her she did not have a PE or lun cancer. They didn’t even check her right leg for a DVT!  She is also lightheaded and said she gets dizzy when she goes to lay straight back or when she touches or lays on a specific area on the back top of her head.  They didn’t even do an MRI!!!! They released her with a diagnosis of coughing up blood - they didn’t even do enough testing to find out wtf is going on!!!!! Please help. Before her contrast ct last night they gave her Ativan via her IV... she went to work after the hospital without sleeping even though she assured me she would sleep. Today, on the way home from work, she actually went off the road and could have Really got hurt. That was almost a full 10-12 HOURS after the Ativan. I realize lack of sleep could cause it but I know something is SERIOUSLY wrong. She has an apt. Monday at 8am. I am going to type a letter with all of her symptoms and demand they admit me her and find out what is causing all of these symptoms. I’m frustrated and disgusted with the care she is receiving. I also took her to the PCP on Monday last week who listened and said that it couldn’t be a PE because coughing blood isn’t a sign of a PE (MORON) and he ordered a CBC diff and lipid panel or whatever and a CT without contrast which he said needed a pre with from insurance.","Silent Stroke , Prevention , Caregiving , Symptoms , Treatment , Diagnosis , Blood Clot"

They said it was a blood clot in my leg and I also have a PFO (hole in my heart which many people have as well). Anyways my concern is this. It was my senior year of college after I had the stroke and I continued doing most of my unhealthy habits a few months following the stroke such as binge drinking on the weekends and smoking cigarettes socially when drunk ( probably around 1 cigarette per week or every 2 weeks) as well as smoking pot occasionally maybe once or twice a month. Now that I am graduated I have just quit smoking and drinking. I am 3 weeks free of drinking and smoking everything. I am so nervous though because I have read a lot online concerning cigarettes. I understand that smoking is bad but I cannot go back in time and unsmoke the cigarettes I have already. I understand I put myself at risk by smoking but does smoking the amount I did (significantly less than a pack a week) put me at a decreased risk of future stroke than those who smoke a lot more. I ask this question because I am so deathly horrified of having another stroke and am losing sleep over this anxiety and simply because I feel as though I have done some damage and was wondering if it is too late.

Brain & Nervous System Disorders,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/53476/minor-tremors-and-ridgid-muscle-movements,Minor tremors and Ridgid muscle movements,"Hi there. I decided to post this to see if anyone has any experience with this odd medical situation I’ve been having for the last week.  Before I go into further detail I just want to preface by saying that I do have a doctors appointment set up next week because I know most of the responses below are probably going to consist of recommendations to make a doctors appointment to get a proper diagnosis, which is completely understandable.  So about a couple weekends ago a buddy of mine gave me a homemade cannabis edible. It was just a gross tasting little glob about the size of a tic tac. I’m not really into taking any sort of illegal drugs but didn’t see any harm in taking it at the time. Where I believe I may have gone wrong, or at least amplified the problem, was the fact that I had already had a few drinks that night. Anyway, to make a long story short, after about an hour or so of feeling some slight euphoria, things started to take a turn for the worse. I started feeling very weak and my motor movements seemed to really be affected. My movements all seemed to be very ridged and not smooth. I also started noticing that my muscles were shaking when I would engage them. For example, touching my thumb to my index finger would cause those fingers to shake noticeably. When laying down in bed and relaxing my muscles, they wouldn’t shake but after laying down for a minute I noticed my whole body start to have this rhythmic rocking to it. Like someone sitting in a rocking chair, just to a much lesser extent. I really just felt awful and I wish I had never taken that thing and couldn’t wait for it to all be over.  Anyway, fast forward to the next day and thankfully I don’t feel like death anymore but I notice that I still have these symptoms, just to a lesser degree. I still felt weak and just not quite like myself. I can still feel my muscles vibrate and shake when doing certain actions. I figured I probably need more time in order to recover from whatever it is that’s causing these symptoms.  Fast forward another couple weeks to today, and I still don’t feel back to normal. I still feel slightly week. And the muscle shaking, although much better than that night, is still there. When I touch my thumb to my index finger at certain times and positions, I can get them to still lightly shake. If I lift my leg up, it’s a smooth motion, when I lower it back down I can feel my core shake slightly. Same goes for lifting my arm and lowering my arm as well. I have noticed that drinking caffeine (which I have always done) does amplify the effects I just described. I have also noticed that adrenaline does amplify the effects as well, such as being in a confrontation.  I am a very active person. I weight train along with run 4-5 days a week. I’ve also noticed the more noticeable shaking while l weight train, and after a hard workout or a long run when I normally feel weak, the symptoms are worse then too. I’m racking my brain to try to think of things I might be doing currently that could either be contributing to this or possibly preventing me from fully recovering. Am I running too much? Am I not eating enough calories? Am I stressing too much? Should I change my diet? Should I stop my medication? (Zoloft). Am I vitamin deficient? I have no idea, especially since this all seemed to just appear out of nowhere after that incident I described. As I mentioned above, I have seen a number of posts from people that describe similar things to what I’m describing without really seeing what their outcome is. I remember back maybe 12 years ago, I had similar symptoms that seemed to come out of nowhere. I went to the doctors. They did blood tests. Numerological tests, ect.

I usually had it 2-3 times a year in a night when I was a child. Most seizures were 2-3 mins in duration.  I took Depakin for a few year. After remission, I stopped taking it.  I now suffer from epilepsy every few years. Specifically, age 17,20,23, and now this year at 27.  My questions:  1) I seem to get epilepsy when I'm stressed and tired. Is this a coincidence or not?  2) Can I live without taking Depakine?  3) Can I die if nobody is around me during a seizure? 4) Can I take Urbanyl when I feel tired or stressed or have a headache to stop any potential seizure?",Epilepsy/Seizures

About 3 years ago, I snorted a small bump of cocaine. Around 20 seconds later, I became very dizzy, and nearly lost motor and bowel control for a duration of around 10 seconds. I have a history of generalized anxiety/OCD disorder and I assumed it was an anxiety attack (about taking the drug) that combined with the drug to give me that reaction, however I would like to hear a professional opinion on the symptoms.   Fast forward to the present. One thing I have noticed within this past year is that I have slightly less feeling on the left side of my body. I have had a CAT scan that has shown nothing. The only thing I could attribute this imbalance to was that one incident a long time ago. I have had no other issues other than a bout of vertigo last year, which was cured by an Ear, Nose, and Throat doctor and has not recurred. I would like some professional insight on all of this, what are your thoughts? Can a small dose of cocaine produce catastrophic long-term effects?","Living & Managing , Symptoms"

I only felt a grogginess after my head snapped forward but thought I would be OK. The grogginess soon became a mix of dizziness, periodic headaches, sudden, short term memory loss and a noticeable loss of balance when I hike or play basketball. I saw my doctor about week or so later for a yearly physical and mentioned my symptoms. Blood tests revealed my cholesterol was higher, now on the high side of normal. She ignored my other symptoms. About a month or so later I went back to see her as the symptoms persisted. She had a trauma specialist examine me and both concluded I must have a concussion. I should also not that the drivers insurance company did not honor their stated policy to give victims a replacement vehicle. So I went 44 days without a car or the ability to drive to my gym to exercise. Then when I finally bought a different car my first time playing, I got Plantar's Fasciitis so missed another 38 days of exercise. So my weight jumped up 10-15 pounds in this timeframe. Exactly three months after the car accident, I had a stroke. The concussion symptoms remained a daily event with the addition of slurred words and a sagging left face. They kept me in the ER for 3 days doing a CAT Scan, MRI, Echo and I think one called a Bell test where I saw live heart imagery. I appreciated the care and occasional ER Docs visits to me. They said I had a full Ischemic stroke but it seemed I had been having lesser ""shower effect"" strokes for a while longer.  When I suggested and asked my GP Doctor if there was any correlation between a concussion and a stroke after sharing my logic, she only said ""I disagree"". She was visibly uncomfortable with me even asking, though the practice says it encourages patients to ask where confused. She dropped me without any word to me. I have always been a good patient and highly ethical, but was concerned she stopped my now life vital Warfarin prescription renewal three times. Last week I saw an article on Web MD and one by the Journal of Science and Medicine stating ""A strong correlation between a concussion and a stroke. They even go on to say there was a tenfold chance that a concussion victim would have a stroke 3 months later, exactly when I had mine. I will speak again with my Neurologist but I sense a gap between these new reports and doctors formed opinions. I also want to properly close out my insurance claim so Medicare can be reimbursed for where it covered concussion-related treatments. I realize there is less certainty with concussions and strokes and also that much of medicine is probability based. But without a medical opinion on the subject with regard to my circumstances given I still have some of the same concussion and stroke symptoms, I just feel like the system is working around me.  I appreciate my doctors and yet am not sure this matter has ever gotten the proper attention. If you know of any other research or second opinion sources, I appreciate it.","Symptoms , Diagnosis"

On April I started having heart palpitations randomly so I went to the ER, general doctor there asked for an ECG which come back normal so he prescribed me Xanax 0,5mg/ once a day for 5 days, after 10 days the palpitations stoped. Couple of weeks later they come back this time I also got Ill with zebra I think was a bad cold, I had fever of 38, headaches and mucus. I noticed it took me a long time recovering from that cold. When I got better 2 weeks after since I was still having palpitations I went to the cardiologist. He listened to my heart and told I had a heart murmur I/II degree, did a 24 hour Holter and found I was having tachycardia, and sinusal breathing arritmia. The Dr said it was nothing serious so prescribed nothing. Meanwhile I had lost 5kg in a month ( probably because of the cold). Had an investigation of what was causing the heart murmur so I did:  Thyroid eco: found several cistes on thyroid  Heart eco- all normal and functioning normal no alterations  Thyroid hormones tested- TSH, T3 and T4 all within normal range  Blood work- all normal  Nose and throat bacteria test- found a Kleibsiela bacteria on my throat (antibiotics prescribed for that) nose come back clear.  During that time I started experiencing sometimes pain on my left arm ( I thought I would have a heart attack) but it went away  I had electric shock like sensation down my right arm or shoulder sometimes but it would last miliseconds (that also stopped)  I experienced sometimes at night my temperature raising and a little bit of sweating (really minimal sometimes just between my breasts a bit)  I still have excessive hair loss and recently had to have my hair cut short (but I also been trying a new hair relaxer and dye it might be it. I just never had so much hair loss before)  I noticed jerk like movements when I'm about to fall asleep at the first it happen 3 times now I have muscle spasms constantly they are very small and last miliseconds too  My heart had no reason to be having arritmia so I was sent to the endocrinologist.  Showed all my lad work and was sent to have anti- thyroid anti-corps tested.  It takes two weeks for me to get the results so I have to wait.  Since this first started I have eye discomfort but for the past 3 days I sometimes had something ""flow"" on my peripheral vision but bothers me. It's like I can catch any movement or light and it is just a weird perception and I see even small particles floating on the air.

Initially, the only way I knew how to categorise the weirdness is ""epileptic"" but... I've been looking into seizure types and I don't quite fit the definitions. I am not currently diagnosed with anything more than asthma. When I was born, I was premature and had jaundice. No other complications known. I show symptoms of a dissociative disorder, AD(H)D and/or autism, and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/ME). I have undocumented CPTSD and only have panic responses (no OCD or habits gained). I am underweight. Here's what weirdness I get: - Random 'neck bounces': I'll just start bouncing my neck up and down (like those videos of birds bouncing to dace to music), quite rapidly but only small movements. It rarely disrupts my ability to think and I'm always conscious. Usually only when I'm seated, but does happen when I'm stood up too. Never when I'm laying down - Limb bouncing: usually my arms, with the ""bounce"" originating at my wrists, or my legs with the bounce originating at my knees/thighs/hips. This sensation feels like my brain says to my body ""need to stretch legs"", but my body bounces instead of just stretching. I'm able to ""interrupt"" it, but I usually still have the ""need"" to stretch. Usually happens while sat down, sometimes while laying, rarely while standing. - 'Body lockup': my whole entire body just stops. I feel my eyes go vacant. Sometimes my head will drop forwards a little (only by an inch or so) and will sometimes also either tilt to the left, OR my face will drop so I'm facing left. I can still move my eyes, and when my head drops, I will continue looking at the ""normal"" eyeline, meaning I end up looking annoyed as sometimes my brow furrows slightly. My arms relax. My hands ""reset to a default position"", sometimes they feel like I have rigid gloves on, making them unable to move until I recover. Sometimes my wrists will curl in, towards my torso. I cannot move much until I forcefully regain control by remaining calm and thinking about moving. It presents like a complex partial seizure but I am completely fully aware. It feels like I'm trapped in my own body. Often afterwards I am tried or grouchy. Sometimes I get fuzzy on what happened about 5-10 minutes after the episode. Rarely, it feels like what happened before the episode was ""a day ago"", that everything that happened after is ""today"", and I forget almost everything that I was previously aware of. I think this has only happened when I've been seated. I can sometimes feel it coming on, especially if I'm stood up, but I don't really recognise it until after. When it ""comes on"" while I'm standing, I can brute-force my way out of having an episode by just maintaining action (eg: thinking about moving, the same strategy I use to break out of it). If I'm walking and its particularly bad, I will come to a stop, but this is actually jarring enough for my brain to ""snap out of it"". - Arms randomly curling up. I hate to be that person, but you know how some people with disorders like cerebral palsy have their arms contorted weirdly, often curled up on their chest? Sometimes I do that. I just bring my arms up and in, and my hands do the sort of hand position you make when giving someone a piece of paper (thumb angled in slightly, fingers curled around it and the base of it...) while touching the backs of my hands together. As with the leg/arm bouncing, it feels like a stretch, and I can ""interrupt"" it but I still feel like I need to do it. Happens when standing or sitting. Might happen when laying? - Slapping/smooshing my hands together. Not sure how to explain this one. It's a bit weird. Imagine laying on your arms until they're numb, then try to clap. Happens when sat down or standing/walking. Don't think this happens when I'm laying down. I know that these symptoms might read as autistic/AD(H)D stimming, or dissociative behaviour, but I can tell you this: The sensations inside my body and inside my head are so much different. I'm certain that these aren't caused by the things I already listed. My questions are: 1) Does anyone know what I might be facing? 2) How do I bring these up to my doctor? Every way I plan it feels... Weird. Any help appreciated. Thanks.",Epilepsy/Seizures

To give some background (I have no idea if this has anything to do with my current condition) I have had bad stomach tension in the middle right area of my stomach and pain for the past few years along with nausea. about a year and a half ago, I had my gall bladder taken out due to it not working properly and I thought that my problems were solved. A few months ago, the problem came back with more tension and less nausea. This has already been quite uncomfortable, causing so much tension that my neck and back end up extremely sore and difficult to move. 8 days ago, I started to feel extremely dizzy and lightheaded at work. I got sent home and the problem got worse. I started monitoring my blood pressure and it is fluctuating every minute or so pretty rapidly. The top number goes form 110-180 extremely quickly without any reason and the bottom number usually stays around 80, but yesterday it went to 120 multiple times. I am now always slightly dizzy and lightheaded and I cannot even do something like take the dog for a walk without losing all my color and falling. I have passed out twice after attempting to push myself. I have also gone to the ER twice, urgent care once and attempted to figure out the problem with my new primary care doctor. The ER did an EKG and bloodwork which were fine, though I I was experiencing syncopy, with my pulse at 46-49. My blood pressure was still all over the place, but they said they couldn't do anything unless it was a life threatening emergency and sent me home both times with a prescription for meclizine. The meclizine has not helped. The Urgent care doctor actually was able to have me almost pass out into her arms by having me sit down and stand up rapidly and recommended a CAT scan along with more monitoring how simple actions affect my blood pressure. They sent me to the ER that once again did nothing and did not even monitor my blood pressure on the second visit (Besides taking it once and seeing that it was 160/80) My primary care doctor was my last hope, but because of the fact that I was prescribed xanax over 6 years ago, he refuses to believe anything other than xanax withdrawal is the cause.I was also running a fever of 100.4 yesterday that ibuprofen took down and I have lost 6 pounds in the last week and a half despite eating normally. If anyone has an idea for some relief or a possible solution to this issue, please let me know. this last week has been an absolute nightmare and I don't know what I can possibly do. I have not been able to work and simple tasks are very difficult. I know there are so many random symptoms, but if anyone has any clue or similar experience, i would greatly appreciate the help",

It's amazing that only two people have participated in this discussion, so I thought I would give you some reassurance and hope. First of all, I'm glad that Mexican scam surgeon didn't have a chance at amputating your foot/feet! Amputating my feet as a solution to my problem has been a family joke for some time. However, I would never consider it seriously, though my pain must not be as bad as yours. As a matter of fact, it's usually mild to moderate. It's the constant motion of my toes that's driving me and my family crazy! My symptoms started in January or February of this year, but I didn't see a neurologist for it until May. I was put on Lyrica and Gabapentin for a month each without any improvement, so I was referred to Mayo Clinic in Rochester, where I have been seen by Dr. Anhar Hassan, who turned out the top specialist in the world, from what I have seen: she is the co-author of the largest-case study on PLMT: ""Painful Legs and Moving Toes Syndrome. A 76-Patient Case Series,"" published in August 2012 at ""Arch Neurol/vol. 69 (nr. 8).  Since my main complaint is toe movement, and I think that if that is stopped, the pain will go away, Dr. Hassan is starting me on Ropinirole (Requip) 1 mg a day, gradually increasing the dose. If, after 9 weeks of treatment, I haven't felt any improvement, she'll try another medication. This is a very rare condition indeed: Mayo Clinic had only seen 76 cases in 28 years (their study covered 1983 to 2011), and they see an average of 4 cases of PLMT per year. So we are basically guinea pigs, a rare breed. However, I am hopeful that they will find a successful treatment, if not to cure it, at least to lessen the movement and the pain. If you haven't been to Mayo Clinic, I would strongly recommend it to you. I hope you two are doing better. I'm glad we ""met"". Please give me an update, if it's not too much trouble.",

I had memory issues, falling and sometimes speech problems. In 2014 was diagnosed with elevated ammonia levels, seizures and post encephalitis. I have been falling very frequently. In fact l just fell in my doctors office 2 1/2 weeks ago and l was recovering from a fractured leg which is not the first time. My first neurologist after my first TBI said l had partial seizures, the next carpal tunnel and Parkinson's disease. And my last one non epileptic seizures and conversion disorder. Now l.have fallen so many times it unreal and lots of places. My hands trembling, slurred speech, balance issues. Sometimes have one of my family member to help me go to the restroom. I finally got tired of my doctors because you are trying to tell them something is wrong and they come back with psychotic, bipolar and schizophrenia. And l been to rehab constantly in patient and outpatient. Matter fact l am going now. I had so many surgeries from falling it should tell the doctors something. I have autoimmune disease. One is encephalopathy because of my liver. And l was told before after my biopsy l didn't have cirrhosis and after this last hospital admission on my records it say l do but the doctor said everything was okay. So when l did my research l have the same symptoms of autoimmune encephalitis, when l went to the mayo clinic they said possible because l wasn't showing signs at that time. But their only 2 doctors there that specializes in it. But l definitely have autoimmune encephalopathy. I take lactulose for that. Then my neurologist that l stop seeing since l went to the hospital he works in when l was admitted l had to see him because he was the last one l saw. Now when l fell in the doctors office l hit my mouth and it was bleeding. And l thought it might have been my ammonia levels since it's been high for the last 3months and it was high 3 days before l fell. Now l had to have help for 2 days to get out vfc the bed to go to the bathroom. I remember one evening the nurse said she was giving me my keppra by lV. As soon as she gave it to me l felt a burning but l thought it was running to fast but it wou lm d be okay. Well it wasn't so.l tried to ring the call light to get help and l drop the hand control because my hands were temor so l tried to hit the call light on the bed but l couldn't. Then l felt my head shaking. The nurse came in and l didn't even know how she knew l was having a problem. Then l just blanked out. Now after all this was over l felt fine. I don't know how long this was going on. The next night it happened again l was told  I don't know if it was meds or a seizure. Then when it was over l tried to text my daughter to bring me something for breakfast but when she saw the text l couldn't understand and she told me she couldn't either. So l called my husband since l couldn't text and that was hard too. I had problems touching the numbers on my cellphone but l didn't give up. When he talked to me he couldn't understand me because he said my speech was slurred and this happens quite often. I don't know it but other people tell me that. So  I was always asking the nurse about my ammonia levels and they were checked only twice. When l was in er and when l was discharged. Then the neurologist comes in to discharge me and he said everything came back okay. He's crazy he needs to go back to medical school because if you have autoimmune encephalitis they said everything can come back okay even your EEG. I got that from the UK and also the autoimmune encephalitis alliance that's the mayo clinic site and a women wrote a book on it she went through the same thing. They are now taking about it and trying to educate doctors because a lot of people have been diagnosed with mental illness which they said could have possibly had or have it. Now when l was discharged l didn't sign any discharged papers and the nurse gave me no instructions. I showed my text and she told me yes that's one of the symptoms of autoimmune encephalitis. So now get my discharged papers and they have on hepatic encephalopathy with cirrhosis, hepatitis C, TIA, fronta lm dengentive disease which was ruled out at the mayo clinic, conversion disorder, non eplipetic seizures, depression and other things but everything was normal. My daughter called the mayo clinic and she told me liver doctor there what was going on. He told her to ask the doctor there to run a test since one of my liber shunts is slightly open snd blood was wasnt flowing. Then he said they might not do it because you have gotten a second opinion and they found something. He was definitely correct on that one. Oh forgot to say twice they gave me aspirin and l been allergic to it since 2005 and it's on all my records and so l got bruises on my legs. So today l am going to see my gp and then in October l go back to the mayo clinic because the doctors here are so blinded about diagnoses at least the ones l have gone to except 3 since 1997- 2018. I have been given meds from the doctors and pharmacy that were recalled. Thank God for wisdom. And l can say for 19yrs with memory problems and lots of prayer l can remember a lot and l am writing my first book about what l went through.",Epilepsy/Seizures

What more can I do to get better?,"This journey of mine started with an incident that happened to me when I was in my apartment last October. Nobody knows exactly what happened. One work day I did not show up at work and I did not call in, and that’s not the way I normally operate. One of my co-workers got very worried and vocal about me missing, to the point my boss drove to my apartment and banged on the door. Someone eventually opened that door, and they found me passed out in my bed, bleeding on the right-hand side of my head.  They took me to ST. Luke’s hospital and performed a craniotomy, to stop the bleeding. Someone called my younger brother in New Jersey to tell him where I was, and that they did not think I would survive. He flew out here immediately in shock. Three weeks later, I was transferred to a rehabilitation clinic in Overland Park, Kansas, where I was still in a wheelchair. It was there I began to regain my memory, because I do not remember the hospital at all.  They had put in a feeding tube in my stomach because they were afraid I would choke to death because I did not swallow correctly. This takes all the joy out of your life by not being able to eat and taste food.  I remember when a therapy girl helped me by removing all the staples they had used to close my head back up. 45 staples. The person stapling my head must have had a grand old time banging away.  So here at this rehab place they would feed me by pouring glop into a tube connected to my stomach. In the afternoons, they would take me to a GYM to do some exercises. I spent most of the time sleeping and watching TV.  Several weeks later a new person stood in my room and drove me to Omaha Nebraska to a rehabilitation place named QLI. I was there for 4 months. If anyone had previously told me about this place, I would not have believed them. It’s something you must experience.  QLI is on a large piece of land with many buildings. They have 10 houses for residents to live in, each house has 8 to 10 bedrooms. I was in house 2. It sure was different for me to be among so many people. I am single and live alone, so this was defiantly different.  One other building has a big room where they zap you while you pedal a stationary bike. They also have a big thing they call “ZERO G”. Zero g is a very long I-Beam that they put you into a harness, connect you to a trolley, can raise and support some of your body weight, allowing you to walk under the I-Beam somewhat like a normal person.  There is another room that has a submersible treadmill. There you change into a swimsuit, walk out onto a platform that has the treadmill on it, hold onto the handrails, get lowered into about 4 feet of heated water, and begin walking on the treadmill.  Another building is filled with offices, meeting rooms, and a big gym. Part of what I did for a living was Corporate Instructor, where I teach up to 10 guys from our service shops around the USA all about a product they will be installing, servicing, and repairing. Part of my job is preparing, creating, and presenting power point presentations. QLI obtained a couple of these from my boss, and I presented them to a meeting room full of people at QLI as if I was instructing a class. One of the girls, named Alex, filmed my presentation on her phone without my knowing. When I found out about it later, I remember I got very mad at her, calling her a “sneaky redhead” She laughed and laughed!  House 2 has a large room filled with many tables to eat at, as well as a couch and comfy chairs to sit in, with a TV. They had a large kitchen, stove, microwave, and three refrigerators. They would take me to a local food store to buy frozen dinners, so If I did not like what they were serving, I could have something else.  Yes, I could eat again. It happened after they took me to a hospital for yet another swallow test. This is where you eat and drink foods while they take X-Rays of you swallowing. And this time, I passed the swallow test. Shortly after I did, one night, at about 8:30, a new lady appeared in my room, said she was a nurse, and was here to remove my feeding tube. I asked her if it was going to hurt, and she said “YUP!”.  She grabbed the tube, told me to take a deep breath, and pulled it like she was trying to start a lawn mower. It popped out of me causing deep pain. She wiped up the mess and taped a big gauze pad over my stomach. I moaned for a half hour before ringing for aspirin. Then I could fall asleep. It just kept getting better after that. Because NOW I could eat real food!  At QLI they did lots of exercise both in the mornings and in the afternoons. They taped pads to my leg and shocked me while I pedaled a stationary bike. They took me for walks with a walker, and had me climb stairs. One day, they took away my wheelchair and gave me a cane and a leg brace. I missed that chair for 2 weeks!  I had to have an escort walking with me when I had to go to exercise sessions. The walk was about a city block. They would put a gait belt on me and sometimes hold onto it. So, I used to sneak out by myself and walk, and sometimes I would get halfway there when I heard running feet behind me, and a loud voice saying “WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE ALL BY YOURSELF?” I really miss those times!  One day, I was walking back to house 2 and decided to take a short cut across the grass. I miss stepped, lost my balance, and fell. I was not hurt; it was soft grass. But there was nothing to grab onto to get back up, so after trying to get up and failing at it, I gave up and waited for someone to come out and help. They all came out one at a time and stood near me, laughing, asking me how the air was down there, and generally having fun with me. I was sure to avoid taking any short cuts from then on.  They found out I like to cook food, and am good at it. I started planning a weekend meal for the people in the house. I would go with an escort to the food store, buy the food, and usually on Saturday prepare and serve dinner for anyone who wanted to have it. I made stuffed peppers one time, stuffed cabbage another time, lemon whole chicken, and lots of other things. All my cooking was greedily consumed down to the last bite with lots of compliments!  QLI has a room where they kept special bicycles that were low to the ground. Some of these were 2 people bikes. One day we loaded 6 bikes into pickup trucks and drove to a riding trail that was supposed to be 40 miles long. It ran in the middle of some blocks between the houses and back yards, behind businesses of all kinds, and along a chuckling creek. We peddled 3 miles out and 3 miles back. It was a LOT of fun! We would go riding on the QLI campus as well. And if it was raining, they had a stationary one set up in front of a computer. It was almost like riding one outside for real.  My insurance was due to stop paying QLI, and I found out that during one of their appraisal meetings one of the therapists was very vocal about me, and said if I were to stay another month I would be very much better. So, QLI gave me a free month at their own expense for me to succeed. I can almost cry when I remember this. I told their CEO “thank you” in person, god bless you and QLI! She just smiled, and said her job was easy, all she had to do was say “YES”.  My Therapists once drove me home for a day trip. Alex and Megan and I. Megan saw where I lived and recommended some things; like handrails in my bathroom, which I did have installed. She scrubbed my refrigerator sparkling clean! It was empty and turned off. Alex was visiting where I worked and seeing my desk and other things. It was just for the day, so we drove back. It’s a three hour drive each way.  The next trip I took home was with Roni. She drove us, and I stayed home and slept in my bed for three days. I went to work as well, and while I was at my desk answering phone calls, Kim from Human Resources, and my boss, were both sitting nearby listening to me talk of the phone as they were also busy on their laptops. After three days, I guess they were satisfied that I was doing OK. I must say I am a lucky man to have such a job. I have been treated very well. But I have also worked for them since 1979!  The day came that I was discharged from QLI, and they drove me home for the last time. I was there for about 4 months. I miss the place and all the wonderful people there. But I do keep in touch with many of them via email. They are wonderful people who did so much for me.  Before I was discharged, Roni and Vanessa and others asked me about continuing therapy on an outpatient basis in Kansas City, and we found Ability KC. I chose this place because they are local, AND they have a driving program as well. I have a nice Crown Victoria that is waiting for me, but I want to do it right.  At this point I have completed a physical therapy course and also an occupational therapy course. I continued to go twice a week there for electrical stimulation on my right leg while peddling a stationary bike. But now I am taking a break from therapy and thinking of what to do next.  So, I am still walking with a cane and am still weak on my right leg, ankle, and right hand. What puzzles me is what happened? My understanding about a stroke and bleeding on the right hand side of the brain would affect the left side of the body. But I am affected on the RIGHT hand side. I am seeking suggestions as to what might have happened to me, and what I can do to improve to the point of not needing a leg brace or a cane to walk around. Thank you, and god bless you. John M",

If you are awake for the next 12 hours then drink 8 oz of 4 servings. In 6 hours then it is 8 oz of 2 servings. It is ideal to drink 8 oz of 8 servings as a maximum if you do not know how to calculate the average amount to drink or if you wants to be on the safe side. For a regular stroke, the same theory is applied, but use water therapy. If it is hot, take cold showers or use ice. If it is cold, warm or hot water will do the trick.

Why am I concerned?  1. In the last 5 years, I've had 2 relatives drop dead from Strokes(albiet both were 50+).  2. I'm black. Yes being black gives you a higher risk. 3. I have the sickle cell trait(not the disease).  4. I have a BMI of 40 5. I have high blood pressure 6. In recent days I've experienced an odd inability to swallow my saliva naturally. I have to make an effort somewhat to swallow my spit. But swallowing food and water is fine.  7. Sudden onset of headaches. They're not the worse headaches ever, but they can be somewhat intense...like a 4 or sometimes a 5 out of 10.  8. On and off, occasionally, the right side of my neck experiences some numness. 9. I don't know if I've experience any dizziness or disorientation(never had it before), but while walking at work, the floor looks wobbly.  10. Lately, I can notice the forgetfulness more than usual.  I have not experienced blurred vision, face droop, slurred speech, or any of the classic signs of an immediate stroke. But I do suspect that I showing signs of mini strokes. I've been to the ER 2 times in the last 2 months and the problem is, unless you show the most IMMEDIATE, DROP TO THE FLO, signs of a stroke, they(ER MD's) will say ""Oh you're young, it's very unlikely, such and such."" One of the two relatives was my dad, and perhaps his death is what puts the concern to the forefront of my mind.Originally he had his stroke while teaching a classroom. After the stroke, he successfully stood up and tried to teach the class(lol), thats until he tried to talk and thats when his students knew there was a problem. They rushed him to the hospital and he tragically passed(from a subsequent stroke 3 weeks later). Even before he passed, he went from not remembering who I was, to gaining 70% of his memory back(I get my number from our conversations). I bring up my father as an example to say this, I suspect that I'm having ministrokes. But because I'm so big and physically strong(mentally strong too), I'm not keeling over like the average person would do so. Hence, when I test strongly in front of MD's, automatically dismiss the notion that a mini stroke is happening. Now, I may be a hypo, but I don't want to die to find out I'm right.  1. If a doctor does not believe, what diagnostic tests should I demand? 2. What medications should I demand? My dad was on blood pressure and thinner meds, is it the same for anyone? 3. Should I shoot straight to a neuro doctor?  Thanks for the response to my likely hypochondriac post.",

I’m now 4 months in and they are continuing - getting worse and more frequent. I actually know exactly when I had the first one – I was on holidays and departing the hotel and I got this head rush that was very sharp and lasted only a few seconds. It felt like someone stuck a needle in my brain full of adrenaline. I could feel the rush come from behind my right eye and it was so strong I got tingling down my entire body. These “rushes” only last a few seconds and don’t interfere with my balance / motor skills nor do I have any cognitive break etc.… they are just very annoying and generate a bit of anxiety. The rushes are not painful and no noise heard. After that first one, I was experiencing them 4 or 5 times every hour for the next month. For that first month, they generally only occurred when I was in situations that had a bit of anxiety involved – good or bad: i.e. playing a video game and monster jumps out, watching TV and phone rings… initially the sensation was almost pleasurable – almost like a release of sorts. Again, they only last a few seconds and once over, I do get an anxious feeling. Initially, in-between these episodes I felt fine. For the first month I just wrote these off as I must have picked up a bug while on vacation (I was in New York). Few items about me – I have never had any issues with depression or anxiety in the past and take no drugs and am a very moderate drinker.  I began to get worried the second month as the head rushes started to occur every 10 minutes of so regardless of what I was doing – no anxiety needed. These new head rushes are similar to the more anxiety generated rushes just a bit milder. They also last just a few seconds. In the second and third month of this issue, I got as many as 80 of the milder rushes a day. As of right now (four months in), I get the milder rushes up to 160 a day. I swear I can feel a build up to each rush in the minute before they occur. I still get the “sharper” and more anxiety driven rushes as well but 3 or 4 an hour. These rushes also occur at night and the sharper ones will wake me up. I’m off work at the moment and have very little stress in my life.  In addition to the head rushes, in month 3 and 4 I started experiencing general fatigue and am now sleeping 12 hour a day. I usually run on my treadmill for an hour and now can only manage 20 minutes before I am exhausted and drenched in sweat. One of the worse problems I am now having related to this is I have no sex drive – never had that issue before. I am also putting on weight.  After the first month I went to see my Doctor about this – he tested my thyroid and I was a bit low so am now on 50 mg of synthroid. My vitamin B was a bit low as well so am on a B supplement. As my symptoms are so strange and persistent, I had an MRI on my head done to ensure no tumor etc.… The MRI was clean. Doc also suspected Cushing Disease so have done 2 X 24 hour urine cortisol test. In both tests my cortisol was above average. Doc had MRI on my adrenal glands to see if there was a tumor – MRI was clean. Running out of ideas, my GP has now referred me to an Endocrinologist. The Endocrinologist had me do a blood cortisol test – it came up as abnormal but too low cortisol not too high? Endocrinologist now doesn’t think it is cushing or even endocrine issue?  I have searched high and low on the Net for folks with my similar symptoms – closest I can find are for folks with antidepressant withdrawal (SSRI) however, I have never been on antidepressants and am not on any drugs.  Anyways – saw this forum with folks who had similar symptoms and thought I would post in hopes of finding someone in a similar situation looking for answers.",

She had some weakness with her right leg and hand and the speech was not clear and the mouth was turning to a side a bit.  However, she was in the ICU and after 4 days she was out into a room and her mobility got better each day.  Unfortunately, she was coughing hard and on the day she was to be discharged from hospital we noticed that her stomache was growing and after a CT scan found out that there was blood and clot accumulated in the wall of stomache, right side. An I&D was done by the General surgeon and nearly 1 and half litres of blood and clot was removed. She was back in ICU.  They had to stop all blood thinning medicines hence.  Slowly her right side is weak again and after more than one week of I &D, they have restarted just 75mg of Aspirin but nothing else.  The sad part is now after about 19 days of the first stroke, her right side is completely paralyzed, it seems.  Am wondering, when can the neuro surgeon decide to give her blood thinners now. The general surgeon who did the I&D says her wound on the stomache is getting better with every day and there is no more bleeding or infection there.  In between, the Pulmonologist suspected a lung infection and started some heavy dose anti biotics and he thinks she has reacted to it well, which means hopefully there is no issue with lungs.  she is out of ICU, but absolutely weak in right side.  Please tell me, what would be the ideal process of recovery for her. Will she be able to walk again (they did many CT scans after but says there were no extra strokes!)

Dad is 91, with considerably good health for his age. He became very isolated, inactive, anti-social, and depressed, when started losing his hearing. He refused to wear hearing-aids. We did not know what exactly happened, when he fell in the neighborhood. The back of his head bled; he got 3 stitches. As my family described it, he could raise both his arms, but with weak legs. He couldn't raise his left leg but could with the right slightly. The doctor said that he had a ""mild stroke"" (directly and literally translated into English; it might make a difference in translation in actual meaning). Isn't a stroke a stroke, be it ischemic or hemorrhagic; can it be milder or at different degrees? From what I understood, if one has a stroke, wouldn't he be able to raise both arm and leg from the same side?  I thought my Dad could just have a TIA, because his face did not change and could raise his arms. However, he has been in the hospital for 5 days; his legs are still as weak as the incident just happened. My family does not seem to get all the info from the doctor, so I am just wondering what happened and has happened to my Dad? Can anybody shed some light with me?

I also often drop things especially when feeling particularly weak. I am lethargic, shaky and sometimes get a tightness in chest/restrictive feeling in throat.

I have had full blood count, iron, b12, glucose, liver function, thyroid function, CRP and ESR. All are normal. I had slightly low vit D about 6 months ago despite being the outdoorsy type but I have been having a D3 supplement since then to treat that.

(Had a relapse along the way, maybe PMR ?) 1st November 2016 I ""T"" boned a car on my scooter @ about 30-35mph. No serous damage. Sunday 20th November 2016, suffered temporary sight loss as described above but no other symptoms associated with GCA. No warning at all no other symptoms. Attended Southampton Hospital walk in eye clinic. Prescribed 300mg Aspirin and increased Prednisolone up to 10mg, appointment made at the TIA centre in Lymington, Hampshire. Attended the Transient Ischemic Attack Centre, had an MRI scan of the head and an Ultra sound of the Carotid artery. Scan was clear except for something lurking in the left side of the brain. Supposedly, not in an area connected with my symptoms. Want to do a different scan to be sure later. (3 different opinions on the scan apparently.) Carotid ultra sound, normal. Gave up smoking and drinking a long time ago. Take regular quite testing exercise, gym and cross country running, slim build. Prescribed Clopidogrel 75mg. I had no other symptoms during physical examination and audio/oral/balance tests blood pressure and blood test. The doctor wanted me to take Statins as well as Clopidogrel, which I declined as I did not have high blood pressure or high cholesterol. Reading up on Statins, it would appear to be good for high cholesterol but not much else? I also read how Statins knock out coenzymeQ10 and other essentials, which would partially explain the muscular problems described elsewhere. The heart itself needs CoQ10?

I wasn't wearing a seat belt, and flew into the dash. It was a very bad crash and a very hard hit. I'm not entirely sure what hit me, but something slammed at full force into my left temple (I'm assuming it had to have been the rear-view mirror). It hurt so bad, I couldn't even touch it, brush my hair, or even open my mouth for almost two weeks (It hurt my temple when I opened my mouth). It gradually improved, and got to where it would just very dully ache every other day or so. Well, as of yesterday, my entire head has been feeling pain in random, spread out places (the place that got hit months back hurting the worst). It isn't an unbearable pain or anything, but it's just worrisome. I also feel a tingling, almost numb sensation all across my head, but very amplified in my temple area. It has almost felt like something is ""moving"" where I got hit a few times over the past two days. I'm also going to clarify that I did not go to the doctor after the wreck, so I'm not 100% sure it was a concussion, but I'm just assuming it was due to how hard of a hit it was. My mom insists I'm okay, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that I swam pretty vigorously around 5 days ago (hand stands, flips underwater, lots of playing around with my younger cousins). She said that may could have played a part in it, but of course my anxiety tries to tell me it is something much worse, such as a blood clot or serious brain damage. I've read about Post-Concussion Syndrome, and I'm honestly not sure if this is it (partly because I didn't get the doctor's say that it was a concussion to begin with, but I'm pretty positive myself). I'm mainly just scared that I've developed a blood clot over the past few months due to the impact, and I'm going to have a stroke or something as severe. I know no one can speak for sure on this issue, but any suggestions or experiences with head injuries or anything of the sorts would be very very appreciated. Thank you all in ahead of time! (P.S.

Regardless, the impairments after a stroke can affect a person not only physically, but also emotionally, and a lot of people aren't prepared for these changes. The feeling that you aren't able to do all of the things you used to do can be frustrating, but you're not alone.  Did you suffer any impairments after your stroke? How did it make you feel?

Back in March I started noticing I was having a little trouble talking at work. I was in sales and had a sales pitch that I would say over and over again with no problems. I noticed that I was stumbling over words, stuttering and losing track of where I was. I wasn't extremely bad so I assumed it was stress because things were bad at work and I was looking for a new job. This continued for the next few months. At the end of May I was offered a new job that was exicted about. I quit the job I hated on May 26th since I was given a start date of June 13th. I decided to spend some summer time with my daughter. That job then was postponed a week or two. I tried calling the company several times and eventually was told it was postponed til August. June 25th I was sitting at home with my family when I got a metallic taste in the left side of my mouth. It also felt like something moved in my left ear canal. I assumed it was sinus issues so I took meds and both issues eventually went away. July 2nd we were at my in-laws and I walked out into their garage when suddenly my left cheek went numb. No other symptoms just numb. My husband checked me for obvious signs of stroke. There wasn't any so I went and sat down for awhile. The numbness eventually went away but still felt weird. I went to my Primary doctor July 5th, she saw no signs of stroke either. She gave me antibiotics and said if symptoms persisted that we would do an mri. July 9th I had trouble getting my eyes to focus then starting my left jaw bone started burning/tingling, it worked it's way up to my cheek bone and my left upper lip. I then noticed swelling and felt pressure around my left eye. Called my doc and scheduled the mri. When I got mri results I was told I had a brain tumor and was referred to brain surgeon. I of course freaked out. Surgery was schedueled. My pre op blood work came back showing my clotting function too high, retested, still high. Then I was sent to Hematologist to figure out what was going on. Turns out Several of my clotting functions were high. Because of that They determined I didn't have a tumor but a stroke. Surgery cancelled of course. I'm now on blood thinners to reduce the risk of another stroke.  My problem now is I'm scared all the time. What if it happens again? Worse this time? I cringe everytime I hear stroke mentioned. I'm on blood thinners what happens if I get cut? What if I'm one of the few that get internal bleeding and have no idea?  I'm in training at a new job, not the one I was orginally offered because I can't get ahold of any one there, What if I can't handle this job? What if it's too soon? My family needs the money since our savings is depleted now. I just don't know what to do.",

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/7342/dull-leg-cramp-pain,dull leg cramp/pain,"I have had a dull pain in my right calf muscle, deep, towards the top of the muscle, off and on with varying intensities for about three weeks or more. The day it first occurred, I was at work and just walking up the stairs, there were several ""popping"" feelings in the calf as I tried to walk, which almost made me fall and hurt quite bad day1, until I got off it for a while. Ever since then, no more popping, just a pain of varying intensities, that I wouldn't describe as anymore painful than dull. There is no visible swelling, there are no red marks, there are no lumps. The pain is more intense when I have the foot/leg in an L shape, like im stretching it out, than when it is more loose with toes pointed down. I have been stretching several times a day, including calf raises, calf stretches and various other stretches, which tend to alleviate symptoms briefly, or make the pain even more less intense. I am fairly active, usually run at least 16miles a week and lift weights about 3-4 hours per week. I have been experiencing plantar fasciitis in my other foot (left foot) for about 3+months (almost better), so I originally just expected the calf pain was due to overcompensation for the pain in the left foot. I have been taking magnesium for a month or more, as it was suggested to help (among other things) for plantar fasciitis. I know magnesium can HELP stop calf cramps/pain, but could over using magnesium also CAUSE calf cramps/pain? I have not had an ultrasound. Pain is isolated to the single area, no redness, no swelling.",

We consulted alot of doctors in our country unfortunately no one is able to identify properly.  Mostly came to conclusion of EPILEPSY. However, they dont tell us what should we do, or how can we make it better. Most common answer we heard is that it is common in first 5 years for special cases. so dont worry about it. however we are really worried about him as this is getting worst, fits sometimes goes upto approx 30min until he reaches hospital. Its coming usually after 1 or 2 months randomly.  Furthermore, now recently he can not even walk properly, his balance while walking is getting strange. He can not run. His eyesight got very weak. I am afraid that if we keep on ignoring like this it will get worse. If you need reports , I am happy to provide it you. please let me know what can we do. Any help will be appreciated.

Last week I suddenly began experiencing what I believe falls into the category of distal peripheral neuropathy. I am primarily experiencing constant dull pains that appear and vanish sporadically in my feet and hands - not necessarily the joints but more the muscles and areas away from joints. The pain will appear in one spot, last for 30 seconds, then move to a completely different location. Sometimes it appears in 2 to 3 locations at the same time. Pain varies in intensity but probably avgs a 5 out of 10. Occassionally it feels like getting stuck by a pin - ive more than once thought I was getting bit on the feet by fire ants only to discover nothing there. Additionally, the pain is sometimes accompanied by mild burning sensations in the same general locations. I am also experiencing dull, achey pain in my knee joints, upper back, and thighs.  I do not have a fever, but I'm not feeling fantastic either. I've been feeling pretty tired over the last few days and sometimes I vaugeley feel as if I'm fighting a virus. Question is - should I seek medical attention for this? Is this type of sudden neuropathy indicative of a serious illness/infection or could I simply be fighting off a normal virus of some type. Never experienced symptoms like this before. What kind of doctor would be best qualified to review my case? Thanks",

We are young and inexperienced with the medical system and we are not sure our options anymore.  When my boyfriend was 20 years old, he had his head smashed in with a baseball bat. After extensive surgery, they put a metal plate in his forehead. He does not recollect much from the entire situation. His family and friends said not to even look at the xray. All he knows is the hospital that it was done at.  His forhead causes him great stress and is a constant worry. He feels it is extremely sensitive and fragile. I can not touch his head there because it is uncomfortable to him. It is irritating on some days more than others. It can be itchy or he can have odd headaches. Sometimes he feels as though his head is caving in on itself. He cannot wear tight hats or a bicycle helmet. He feels as though any small accident to his head could cause great damage because the plate feels so fragile. When he is stocking boxes at work, he is extra careful that they do not fall on him from above. I have to be extremely careful of any movement near his head because he fears any hit or contact or could do something bad.  We have been to a doctor who took CT scans and xrays and after much frustration, money, and appointments, the doctor said everything was ""fine and normal"".  My boyfriend is hopeless and feels this is just his life now. He's ""used"" to it. But I don't accept this. We just don't know what else to do. Thank you.",

Possibly Addison’s disease","Hi everyone! I am new here and have read every single thing that’s out there regarding Addison’s disease and I am hoping someone can help interpret my ACTH 60 min stimulation test. Everything I read doesn’t compare my abnormal result and can’t find much on my type of results... which may be abnormal??? The stress of waiting to find out if I have Addison’s is making me feel even worse. I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia about 2 years ago but am not convinced that is what’s wrong with me- and have every rare disorder and diagnosis possible- I see an endocrinologist because I have a small cyst on my pituitary. I also was diagnosed with PCOS from him and I have whacky hormone levels such as testosterone, prolactin and estrogen etc. I have very low blood pressure that gets even lower after I eat. I suffer every single day to get up off the couch or out of bed. I am always extremely fatigued- blamed on my fibromyalgia by my PCP. My blood pressure is symptomatic and is around 90/50 on a regular average lately. It’s usually more like 105/69 on average - which is still low. I have never been treated for my low BO and my PCP keeps telling me it’s fine- IT’S NOT FINE! On top of my fatigue, low blood pressure and overall feeling of being unwell for almost two years, I have many other symptoms. But what I would like to know is if these ACTH test results mean I have Addison’s or anything that could answer why I am so sick. I’ve had abdominal and lower back pain accompanied by Naseau, lightheaded and dizziness for months. Here are my ACTH test results: please can anyone interpret them... my cortisol levels do rise a little bit but didn’t reach the post stimulation standard of atleast 18..  cortisol baseline: 6.4 30 min: 11.7 60 min: 14.3 Prior to this I did a simple cortisol am blood test that was borderline and result was 5.2.. so that’s why we did the ACTH test. I also did an MRI of my pituitary (routine to follow its growth) and my endocrinologist said it was fine and that it didn’t cause any of my symptoms. He didn’t want to give me the ACTH but I demanded answers or more tests because I was so sickly feeling and I know somethings wrong with me. He told me he didn’t expect to have adrenal insufficiency but he ordered the test I think to *** me up! I think my results prove that I was right and he was wrong.. I may be wrong here but please someone tell me the answer to these results. I can’t find anyone that had a cortisol level under 18 after peak/post stimulation while at the same time they still doubled their level from base to end like mine. Thank you so much!",

If I could describe the pain its like a constant pain that is usually aching but gets sharper when I am walking, sitting, and laying down. I am 19 years old and I helped my friend move into his apartment in February which is when the pain started. I thought I had pulled the muscle and brushed it off but the pain has gotten progressively worse. Last week I kept waking up in the middle of the night with severe nausea and back pain. Today I got out of my car and I couldn't even walk. I cannot bend down anymore, even slightly, without being in severe pain. It's very hard for me to get up, especially when I have been lying in bed or even just sitting down in a chair. The pain started in the lower left side of back, sometimes reaching all the way around to the other side and going up my spine. Recently however, the pain has been exclusively on the lower left side of my back, sometimes shooting up my spine, but also it is spreading to my left abdomen and middle abdomen. When I put pressure on my left leg it hurts my back and hip. I was bending down to pick up a towel a few days ago and my back, hip, and the entire left side of abdomen just screamed in pain and I let out a yell.

I find that when I stretch it or move around it tends to go away and when my leg isn't moving is when it often occurs. The earliest I can recall it happening was probably around 3 years ago when I was 14. It may have occurred before then but for some reasons thats when I specifically remembering it happening. I also have two rather large moles on my thigh on the same leg as where the pain occurs but the moles do look quite normal and I have had them for a long time but I am wondering if that could have anything to do with it. Could it also possibly be a circulation issue as I was born with a heart condition which effects my blood flow due to a valve being slightly thicker than normal.

I have 10 ruptured discs in my back, MRI's found them, 5 in my neck C3-C4, C4-C5,C5-C6,C6-C7, C7-T1 that sends a pain down my left arm to the elbow, 3 in the middle of my back T2-T3 T3-T4 T4-T5 that sends a pain around to the front of my chest(thought I was having a heart attack at 1st). 2 in my lower back L4-L5, L5-S1 hitting my nerve. Also I am a brittle type 1 diabetic on insulin pump. I am on 10/325 of hydrocordon 4-5 times a day for over a year and a half now. They are not lasting as long as they use to anymore and not working as good. I tried the Percocet 10/325 and that lasted about a hour, for me the Percocet did not work as well as the hydrocodon. I have a lot of pain each day with 10 total ruptured discs so what would be the next level of pain meds I could try to relieve this pain? Remember Percocets did hardly anything, Also I am 45 years old. I do not drink at all. Pleas give me suggestions, and yes I get shots every 3 months in the 3 different areas but that takes time. What Meds will work for my pain other than the 10/325 of Hydrocodon 4-5 times a day? The doc said I am not bad enough for surgery and I see a pain mntg place each month. I am in PT also",Back Pain

Brain & Nervous System Disorders,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/30591/painful-leg-moving-toes-syndrome-plmt,Painful Leg Moving Toes Syndrome (PLMT),"I have been suffering from PLMT in my right leg and foot since around 2013. I really wish there was more awareness about the condition, hence this long post. It reveals a lot of personal information in the hope that it will help another sufferer to feel less alone, or seek help, or maybe help a doctor/neurologist to assist in the treatment of other PLMT patients. At the expense of all the info, I really hope I do not sound too introspective. I just want, above all, to help someone in a similar position to myself. A brief medical background: I am 49, of average weight (~120lb at 5' 6""). I have never smoked, I don't drink or take illicit drugs. In my childhood I had chicken pox, very bad measles, mumps and in my mid 20's, shingles. At age 19 I was hospitalized with severe anorexia, weighing 64lb. During and after my recovery from anorexia, to the current day, I have been taking many different antidepressant medications, and other psychiatric meds, including first, second and third generation antipsychotics for severe treatment resistant depression, OCD and Bipolar disorder.   Prior to the onset of my PLMT, I was very active. I participated in advanced figure skating, ballet and yoga. In my younger years, up until my inability to walk properly due to anorexia, I was a competitive, national level figure skater with a very rigorous training regime. After my illness and a a 17 year break from the sport, I continued to skate quite rigorously and compete nationally on the adult circuit, until I tore the ACL ligament in my right knee. I did not have any PLMT symptoms at that time, and I had a successful donor transplant of the ACL in 2010.  The PLMT (undiagnosed at this stage) started approx. mid 2013. I remember the first painful spasms in my upper leg (in the quad) driving home from coaching one day. It became quite impossible to continue driving the car and I had to pull over at the nearest Med Express. Just prior to this I had been having a lot of trouble sitting due to pain in the ischium ['sit bone' area]. Doctors either told me it was all in my head or that it was piriformis syndrome and sent me to rehab. Extensive rehab was ineffective. All around the same time I had a fall and tore all three hamstrings in my upper right leg near the ischium. This was disheartening as I had recently taken up ballet and loved this new found activity so much that I continued to try and dance through the pain. Subsequently, the hamstrings did not heal well. It didn't end there. Due to the leg spasms, I started experiencing problems in my ACL again where the pin was inserted, so had to have the pin removed under anesthesia. To compound the picture further, I stopped most of my psych medications suddenly at the same time. I just remember feeling extreme pain all over my body, like a thousand little gates were opening and closing on every area. Thus, it is actually hard to define what caused the PLMT. My neurologist, Dr. Homayoun is really great, and has spent so much time trying to work out the right treatments for me and how to help this rare disorder. I too, really try and study the pattern of movement and pain. I can control the movements when I think about controlling them, but I am quickly distracted because it takes a lot of mental energy. The PLMT is worse when I am at rest or lying down, and best when my feet are on the floor, or I am standing up moving around. I have major leg spasms however, even when standing, when my medication levels drop, or I have missed my dose of Lyrica, and/or the Botox is wearing off. In fact, most of my home life when I am not standing up is conducted lying down on the bed on my belly, either with my laptop, a book, doing crafts, etc., as I cant sit down much (still experience extreme pain in both ischium).  As far as medications: Aside from my psych meds (Effexor ER, Adderal and Abilify) I take Lyrica (600mg day), clonazepam, tizanadine, and baclofen. I also have about 10 injections of Botulotoxin (botox) at one session, every 3 months in between my toes, in other foot areas, and also all up my leg. It's excruciating when given in my foot, but helps a lot with the movement disorder. Recently, after mentioning some new observations at my appointment, I found that new injection points - in the side of the calf and in the groin (where I found that movement appeared to originate in the lower and upper leg respectively) and in the ischium, helped tremendously. I would also like to say that in the beginning stages of treatment, the Botox treatments seemed useless as they would only last about 6 weeks, and the effect wasn't great. It wasn't until over a year later that the Botox started lasting almost 3 months and really quite well. So if you have started such treatment, please do not lose hope! Although all these meds and treatments perhaps work interactively to control my leg movements and pain, by observing missed doses of the various meds, I find that it is the Lyrica, probably along with Botox, that is the most beneficial med in the control of both pain and movement. In fact, when the Botox is wearing off (after about 2 months) and I miss a day of Lyrica, the pain is so impossibly bad that I curl up in bed and just cry. Recently I have been prescribed a Fentanyl patch (25ug/hr) to also assist in controlling pain. I find they are ok, but not fabulous, in treating the pain, but do help to some extent. One day if I am brave, I will miss my lyrica without a patch on. I found it amusing, that when I missed my last Botox injections, I observed my toes were still rhythmically moving when I had the Fentanyl patch on (thus had no pain). This is interesting with regards to theories on the pain-movement cycle.  Well I hope this LONG, long dialogue /info helps anyone, and please post if you want to if you are suffering from this condition or are a doctor etc - I feel so isolated! We need to build awareness of this complicated disease. I was so active and now when trying to fight back by practicing some strengthening or yoga, I find it is a big problem. I am becoming so weak and it is getting harder to dress because I am compensating by overusing other muscles which subsequently hurt more. I sometimes lose my balance and I feel like I am becoming more and more bedridden - Yikes! I look back on my skating days with great memories but it too, is so very, very painful - it hurts my psyche. I am so very thankful to my awesome psychiatrist and therapist, Dr. L Krimer. I don't know where I would be without his unconditional support. My extremities may be weak, but the center holds. Finally, please take time to read the quote I saw and loved and have attached at the bottom. It really helps you through your treatment!",

Brain & Nervous System Disorders,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/51960/where-would-i-get-this-exraordinary-ability-tested,Where would I get this exraordinary ability tested?,"My age is 49, my sex is male, and I am caucasian. All indications are that I have an extremely rare (not sure even how rare, I am sure other people have it, but I could be the only person on the planet to do it at this extreme) autustic ability. Before you read this, please do not dismiss what I am about to say as impossible, because I already had some of this ability tested at my doctor's office and it has atleast been verified that I can do it well enough that it is beyond a normal person's abilities. Furthermore my parents have witnessed me do it all my life. And lastly it took like 8 hours of search on the internet (thats how rare it is to find info on this) to find a reference by a medical doctor who talks about a rare occurence with fibromyalgia that can also happen with autistic patients because of how both disabilities effect the central nervous system. As I understand it, some fibromyalgia and autistic patients only require maybe a 1000th of the stimuli from a sensory gland of a normal person to detect something, because of how their central nervous system gets stimulated so much more easily or reacts much more faster (not sure which). The reference on the internet I found speaks of fibromyalgia patients who can hear the humming of the ballast tubes in flourescent lights that no normal human can hear, because of their central nervous system. That reference also refers to the possibility of it also effecting a fibromyalgia or autistic's sense of smell. In my case, almost all my senses are effected to some extent but smell seems to be effected the greatest. Let me give some examples. When I was around 18. I was in my bedoom behind a closed door, with tape all over the door to keep smells out (thats how sensitive I am to smells), and I am like 40 feet away from the kitchen and my sister cooks a tv dinner (like fish with white wine source). Both my mother and sister are standing 3 or 4 feet from the microwave and can't smell the alcohol. I smell it behind the taped door in my bedoom, from 40 feet away. I also smell odors thru walls, thru pipes, etc. Recently, just happened a couple months ago, I smelled something like a dead animal when I was in a car (the smell was overwhelming to me). Both my parents were in the front of the car and couldn't smell something that was overwhelming to me, and it wasn't until the moving car went for another couple minutes that my parents could finally smell it. So maybe 200 to 300 feet or perhaps more feet in distance before they could pick up the smell. Just another case of how much farther away I can smell stuff then normal people. And as I mentioned earlier my doctors office tested and verified that I wasn't just imagining this ability. I go to a therapist for my autism. The therapist told me that he put a tiny amount of cleaning stuff on a chair to test me (I was unaware that he did it until after the test was over). A patient came in 15 minutes later, and even sat in the chair and could not smell it. Then a patient came in an hour later and sat in chair, and couldn't smell it. Then another in 2 hours, then another in 3 hours. I came in 4 hours later and smelled it, as soon as I opened the door, and could even state where the smell is coming from, the chair. The same therapist also tested me another 20 to 30 times, and each time I correctly identified the smell, and it was a smell that was too weak for normal people to pick up. And today, believe it or not, I smelled better then a gas detection meter. I'm getting tired of typing so will summarize quickly. I lived next to gas stoves for 32.5 years and never reported a gas leak. What are the mathematical odds, if you pick a random day in 32. 5 years to just report that you smell gas and there really is a leak, and it is just coincidence? The gas man is saying it is impossible because his meter (which apparently isn't as accurate as me) didn't pick up the smell in the hallway, when I smelled gas coming from a neighbor's apartment. Never reported something like this in 32.5 years of being around gas stoves. The day I reported it, the gas man, goes into the apartment and checks the stove and there is a leak (I was correct). And just to be clear again: I walked in front of every apartment in the building, didn't smell gas at any, except for the one where the gas man actually said there was a leak and I never reported a gas leak in 32.5 years of being around gas stoves. It would be around a 1 in 60,000 (or higher) mathematical probability that it was done by random chance. The gas detection meter couldn't detect the gas in the hallway, but the only way I could of known which apartment out of all of them in the building had the leak, and the only way I could of reported this on the correct day of the leak (when I never reported a gas leak in 32.5 years) is it was NOT random chance or coincidence. At this point, I really like to find out what is going on and get as close to an exact number to how much better I smell then a normal person. I live in Pennsylvania, but I could travel if necessary.

I have (mild) asthma and allergies. I take birth control, a steroid inhaler, an allergy pill, and nasal spray. I have an average weight, and I walk a few miles everyday and do yoga once in a while. One night in November, I suddenly got severe chest pains on my left side. They stopped after a few minutes. A few weeks later, I had a cardiologist appt and the cardiologist said I have a healthy heart with a few premature heart beats. But it wasn't even close to the level they would worry about. I did mention the chest pains to her, but she not seem fazed about it. The chest pains continued but not nearly as severe as the first time. More like a throbbing or achy feeling. Sometimes I would get the chest pains when I was stressed, like when my sister screamed. I called the cardiologist's office just to get a confirmation that my chest pains were normal, and the person on the phone said it sounds like muscle pain and to take Advil or Ibuprofen. A month later, I moved to Germany for my gap semester. The chest pains were still coming, and radiated more into my right side, my ribs, and my back. The doctor, checking me very quickly, prescribed physical therapy. I went and it hurt a lot in places I don't think it was supposed to hurt. Throughout my first 3 months here, it will hurt for a few days, then go away for a week. I do not notice a pattern for it. So I do not know if physical therapy actually helped, or if it was just going away like it comes and goes. Well, I've been having them again and the doctor prescribed me a lot more physical therapy and gymnastics exercises. But I have been reluctant to go because the insurance I am provided with is a limited amount of money and I do not have enough money on it to do all of the physical therapy appts. So I or my host family would pay out of pocket. What I want to know is, what does this sound like it is? If it sounds like it will be fixed by PT, I guess I will find a way to go.  Just FYI: -it hurts when I put pressure on my ribs or sternum (feels like the whole area is mildly bruised) -I have always had a very sensitive back. When getting massages, I need less pressure -the pain happens most often on my left breast bone -I have mild acid-reflux after tomatoes (my mom sent me medicine for it, but it says to not take if you have chest pain) -does not seem to hurt more when I breathe in or exercise  -therefore, it doesn't seem to hurt more when my heart rate goes up -I THINK before I got these I did chest exercises at the gym. I am not sure if it was before or after, but I think before. I was also doing ballet and we did kind of intense chest stretches.  -I think they get worse when I am constipated or bloated. I have been having constipation because of the heavy diet here, and a bit before I came here because I was just sitting down a lot (studying)  -the pain radiates to my back, shoulder, etc.  The worst part is not the pain, but the fear I have from it.","Chronic Pain , Physical Therapy , Medication , Back Pain"

My vision starts out crystal clear in the morning and then randomly blurs throughout the day. It comes and goes and doesn't seem linked to eating, stress, etc, but when it blurs it gets so blurry that I can't read a computer. The blurring is worse in my right eye and lasts anywhere from 10 minutes to 4-5 hours.  The blurring first started in November when I had a migraine that was so severe I went to the on base ER (in the military). I had a couple migraines as a kid but nothing for about 7 years prior to the November migraine (haven't had any since November). It started with floaters in my vision and intense pain (way over a 10/10 if that's possible, it was honestly indescribable) and progressed to being unable to walk, confusion, complete blindness, and an inability to speak. I could say garbled words and was aware enough to get really frustrated that I couldn't say what I was thinking. then I just couldn't say anything anymore even though I was thinking clearly to myself.  They did a CAT, MRI, and subsequent MRIs with Dye traces, all of which they say came back clear. No stroke, MS lesions, etc.  At this point the military docs are saying they don't know what it is. I have no other symptoms other than the blurry vision and fatigue. Is there a way to make this stop? It really impacts my ability to work. It's not something I want to take up my Chain of Command; I just want it to go away. Thanks!",

When I got the call back of the results I was told I had a moderate hernia c5-c6. It sounded cut and dry. I was referred to a pain and spine specialist who did not want to refer me to surgery and did two injections to the disc and then referred me to pain management meditation.  It wasn't enough after over 10 years of pain I wanted more than just answers. I sought out a referral for a second opinion. I am still waiting for the appointment but I got a copy of my MRI results.  I was surprised that a lot more than a simple moderate hernia was going on. Or so it seemed to me. C5-C6 focal right paracentral protrusion resulting in moderate canal stenosis and mild right ventral cord flattening.  C4-C5 mild spondylosis.  Stenosis is present on both discs.

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/5669/shoulder-still-hurts-five-months-after-a-fall,Shoulder still hurts five months after a fall,"In October, I fell hard directly on my shoulder while playing soccer and right away felt some tingling/numbness. It was late in the game and I kept playing, but as the adrenaline wore off afterwards, I realized I had significant pain and limited mobility in my shoulder, as well as weakness in my arm. The top of my shoulder (above the collarbone) was bulging. I'm pretty certain there was no dislocation, unless it popped out and back in instantaneously without me noticing. I figured I'd had a light shoulder separation. I wore a sling and regularly iced and taped up the shoulder, giving it support. I returned to soccer a few weeks later after most of the pain had stopped, playing only with it heavily taped and supported. Over the next month or two, it gradually got better to the point where I barely noticed it and stopped using the sling, but the improvement seems to have stalled out since. I had planned to do some mobility/strengthening exercises to keep helping it along, but I read that you shouldn't do any such exercises until pain is completely gone, and I still haven't reached that point, now five months after the fall. Currently, any movement that opens the shoulder wide (reaching overhead or behind me, any throwing motion) brings some pain and shows my mobility is still limited. Putting weight on the hand or elbow to that side also brings some light pain, and it remains uncomfortable to lie down on that side. I can also feel tightness around the joint (front, back and side), and I still have a slight but noticeable bulge above the collarbone. I don't know what to do next to aid the healing process. Are there exercises, movements or massages I can try that would help? Should I be taking anti-inflammatories? Should I go back to icing heavily and keeping it immobile and in a sling at all times? If so, how would I even know when it's OK to stop using the sling? The injury never struck me as something significant enough that would require an MRI, let alone surgery, but now that the recovery has stalled, I'm worried that might be necessary. I would very much like to avoid surgery, both because of expense and the lengthy recovery that would come with it. I'm 25 and have never had a significant sports injury despite skiing and playing soccer my whole life. I did play baseball for a long time and I used to pitch, but I never had any major shoulder issue. Any guidance you can provide would be a huge help. Thanks!",Chronic Pain

It started as my tail bone when i fell really hard directly on it, this transitioned to lower back pain and at this point i began going to physio because my posture was terrible and i had to sit out a lot in basketball because it would hurt to walk. Once my lower back pain started to go away i began to get an achy pain on the left side of my chest around my third and forth rib but only when walking for long periods of time. When i would try and stretch out my rib cage it would feel extremely tight and tender. This pain then started to occur every day started about a year and a half ago so i went to the doctor and got and x ray and nothing was wrong. He said it was probably just a muscle strain and that i should just take muscle pain medications. 10 months after that i started seeing an active release therapist because the pain spread all around my chest and the middle of my back. Some times throughout the day i would get sharp stabbing pains in my chest and awful knots all in my shoulder blades and down my spin. And sometimes when i would run my chest muscles would randomly contract and i would be extremely short of breath and could only take short quick ones. The painful spot on my rips feels like a bruise to touch. Also, when i lean forwards and backwards slightly my ribs on the left side pop back and forth. I cant take a deep breath without my whole rib cage hurting and feeling restricted. Also when i suck my stomach in you can see that the left side sticks out more than the right. The active release therapist discovered that I had a rib out of place for about a year and all the muscles around it had adjusted to that position so apparently the muscles are all messed up around that spot. Sorry im all over the place I just have alot to say but if anyone has any answers or comments that would be great.

Visited Dr Mark Govender on the 12/10/2015 who asked me to do have a Doppler ultrasound done to check the blood flow in my legs Doppler ultrasound done and revealed all in order I then starting see a physiotherapist – Dr Tharusha Naidoo on the 15/10/2015. The physiotherapist diagnosed me as having plantar fasciitis and said it will take quite a few treatments to sort it out. I had five physio appointments before I came to  First consult with you and You asked me to keep going for physio but also to see a chiropractor to sort out my back which was also painful at the time. I continued with the physio like you said went to see the chiropractor – Dr Jason Fyfer on the 16/11/2015. I had 7 appointments with the chiropractor who helped to relieve the pain in my back. I was going to the chiropractor and attending treatments with the physiotherapist at the same time. The physio helped relieve the pain but the swelling still continued. I went for 20 treatments with the physio before I decided to come back to you as I felt that the physio treatments were not helping me.  I came to you on the 08/02/2016 and you asked me to do a series of blood tests. We tested for gout and lupus but the tests came back clear. I had another 3 physio treatments and then stopped going for physio and said to the physiotherapist that the physio is not helping me. She wanted to refer me to a neurologist but I decided not to go to him. One of my work colleague’s mother was studying reflexology and said that she will help me with treatments.  I started going to her in the beginning of March and after my first treatment with her I felt relief. I continued treatments with her until the end of April. I then started attending yoga classes which I did for 1 month but then the pain started after doing the attending the first yoga class. I then went back for the reflexology treatments. The lady that was doing the reflexology suggested that I visit my gynae. I had the sterilization done in Feb 2012 and she believed that it might have something to do with it. After the sterilization my monthly cycle was quite painful, heavy and long.  I then visited my gynae Dr M Tsuari on the 03/06/2016. She did a sonar and a pap smear. She discovered a polyp in my uterus and I was asked to remove it. She also did some blood tests to check my vitamin B, D and iron levels. The blood tests revealed that I had iron deficient anaemia.  I was booked into hospital on the 04/07/2016 to have a hysteroscopy to remove the polyp. The gynae did not perform the hysteroscopy as I was told that my uterus was larger than 9mm and therefore she could not perform the hysteroscopy. I had iron supplement via IVF while in hospital and my gynae gave me a script to have another 2 iron injections over the next two months. I was also given Visanne to help shrink my uterus. Three weeks after the attempted procedure I was still bleeding and I queried with my gynae if this was normal. She asked me to come see her immediately.  I went back to her on 27/07/2016 and she did a sonar. She said I should stop the Visanne and she prescribed Femodene Ed to clot my blood and Tranic to stop the bleeding. She also said that when my next cycle starts that I must go back onto the Visanne and stop the Femodene Ed.   I had the iron injection I had quite bad menstrual pain around the 15/08/2016 but my cycle only started on the 17/08/2016. It lasted for 5 days and then I contacted my gynae to find out if I must stop the Visanne or continue with it. I had also mentioned to her that I had the iron injection and that my feet were still swollen and very painful. Her suggestion was to see a physician before I need to see her in November when she will assess if I can perform the hysteroscopy.

I have been in severe pain this week from Monday until today. I have been on my feet a lot over the past two weeks as we were preparing for my brother’s wedding. This could have aggravated it."" Was hospitalised and various blood tests and xrays were done. Blood test only revealed that I have anaemia. Was asked to take iron supplement - Chelafer for 6 months. Seemed to have no pain in legs or feet after hospital visit. Pain and swelling in feet started again. Went back to doctor as pain became severe. Doctor decided to hospitalise me again to run further tests.  I had a full blood count test done. I also had a liver function test& glucose fasting test. I was seen by a cardiologist, specialist physician and neurologist. I had an ECG done and also had a heart monitor and they were all fine. The neurologist made a diagnosis that I had neuropathy. She prescribed Neurontin & Trepiline Also asked me to come back to do a nerve conduction study. Had nerve conduction study done. Awaiting results. Follow up appointment on the 16/05/17 Pain and swelling in feet is constantly felt. I have stopped all medication as I am not sure if the correct diagnosis has been made",

I almost cried because I know something is wrong.) -today she was holding my daughter standing still and lost her balance and said “woah” this has happened more and more frequently! -severe constipation (thinks her bowels were impacted and couldn’t be go to bathroom for a week!) -dehydration -extremely thirsty *My Dad thinks her tripping is normal and I think he is blinding himself to it because he doesn’t pay enough attn or he thinks it’s normal and he said he forgets stuff sometime and loses balance but I can tell you for a fact he doesn’t and if he does it’s nothing like my Mom has been!  Detailed explanation and symptoms: I need help getting my Mom diagnosed and admitted to a hospital until they are 100% positive about her diagnosis.  My Mom has had chest pain for over 6 months, probably a year. She coughed up Blood 2 weeks ago and is not a smoker. In November, when I knew something was wrong; I told her to go the ER - I made her go quite honestly. They did an EKG, and said everything was fine and her heart looked good. I know she has a lung problem, thyroid problem and possibly a brain problem. I am positive because of handwriting analysis. I backed off for a while after her EKG was good because I was worrying her and my parents were both getting upset. She had mild and completely random - maybe once a week or once every two weeks - problems with her memory. She had random leg pain only in one leg and she didn’t know how to describe it. She had a minor and very little cough I think she has been hiding from me. In December, around Christmas, she was watching my baby and she said she reached for something behind the radio and pulled a muscle. I kept telling her to go make sure that was all it was and she just kept ignoring it. She had the pain to where at times I could tell it was bothering her and at times it hurt her to sit and feed my baby when she visited which really bugged me. This pain she had was in her upper left quadrant (near her ribs and she described it as basically from the front of the lower rib area to the back of the lower rib area). She never had it looked at! It hurt her for ATLEAST a month probably more like 2 months.  I have noticed her “tripping” or losing balance for the past 3-6 months but it is becoming more and more often. I said something to her almost every time I seen it happen and she brushes it off as if nothing happened. Well, it has got more and more frequent to the point I’m worried she will fall and really hurt herself or while holding my baby, fall and hurt my baby along with herself!! :(  Also, she told me just recently she has been having a lot more symptoms than I realized. I made her go to the ER last night with the following symptoms: -Coughed up blood clot 2 weeks ago -Fatigue -Anxiety and Stress (she attributes to being from her job and some of it probably is) -Feels like it’s hard to swallow -she is always clearing her throat -recently I see her grabbing her neck more and more (universal sign for choking) -lack of balance -dry cough -feels like she is congested -coughed up almost a 1 inch blood clot less than 2 weeks ago -Charlie horse pains often in her right foot and lower leg (sign of DVT) -she described to me she “felt like there was a blood clot in her neck”  -she physically looks drained -she seems to know something is wrong -she is forgetting things she never should forget (she bought my baby an elephant and it’s head and ears flap - she was SO happy to show my baby this toy and less than ONE or TWO months later, she asked me who got it for my daughter!! I almost cried because I know something is wrong. Her grandma had mini strokes often and her grandma and grandpa were both on blood thinners. Last night they gave her a contrast ct of her chest, blood work and d-dimer and told her she did not have a PE or lun cancer. They didn’t even check her right leg for a DVT!  She is also lightheaded and said she gets dizzy when she goes to lay straight back or when she touches or lays on a specific area on the back top of her head.  They didn’t even do an MRI!!!! They released her with a diagnosis of coughing up blood - they didn’t even do enough testing to find out wtf is going on!!!!! Please help. Before her contrast ct last night they gave her Ativan via her IV... she went to work after the hospital without sleeping even though she assured me she would sleep. Today, on the way home from work, she actually went off the road and could have Really got hurt. That was almost a full 10-12 HOURS after the Ativan. I realize lack of sleep could cause it but I know something is SERIOUSLY wrong. She has an apt. Monday at 8am. I am going to type a letter with all of her symptoms and demand they admit me her and find out what is causing all of these symptoms. I’m frustrated and disgusted with the care she is receiving. I also took her to the PCP on Monday last week who listened and said that it couldn’t be a PE because coughing blood isn’t a sign of a PE (MORON) and he ordered a CBC diff and lipid panel or whatever and a CT without contrast which he said needed a pre with from insurance.",

I've seen many doctors in the States but haven't had much success regarding the daily pain. When I was traveling abroad recently, I decided to see a urologist there to see if anything different could be done for me. The doctor gave me a 30-day prescription for 2 medications: acetaminophen & tramadol. I learned that acetaminophen is the chemical name for Tylenol, but in the country I was in, a much stronger version of it was available via prescription. When taking both provided noticeable relief, I went to that doctor again right before I left the country and asked if prescription-level acetaminophen & tramadol can be taken long-term. He said yes. But when I saw my doctor here after returning to the States, he said they are not to be taken continuously for an extended period of time. I was devastated because I felt that I finally found a pain management system that really worked. So my question arises from these conflicting answers from the doctors. Can prescription-level acetaminophen & tramadol be taken continuously for an extended period of time (e.g., years)?",Chronic Pain

Then I started having tons of foot pain after a few hours. I've tried many different shoes and insole types, ive gone to a specialty place that would be similar to a good feet store, tried plantar fasciitis braces recently. nothing seems to help. The only thing that gives me relief seems to be if I am in really good shape, like running 5-6x a week and hitting the gym, then i dont have as many issues. Currently within an hour of being at work my feet are aching so bad, I can feel it in every part of my foot. this seems to stretch up and into my calves and knees too.  If I go home and go running my feet hurt with every strike, but if i start and stop enough, by the end of my run they will feel SO much better. If i dont go running they will ache all night, and after I sit down for awhile, then get up, It will be like walking on rocks with barefeet. .

Many confusing undiagnosed symptoms.","When I was 12-13 I was running fast in the hallway at school. I dropped my lunch box outward and while running I bent over to attempt to retrieve it and with my head tilted down I hit my head on the corner of a wall hard. I then had a big pool of blood about a few feet wide on the ground. I lived up in the Rocky Mountains and was taken to a small clinic there and they only gave me stitches. No ER room, no tests. The scar is about four inches long.  When I was 14-15 my friend told me I could see cool rainbows if I tried something. He told me to sit upside down on my head on a couch, push and blow air into my head as hard as I could while he held my ears closed, and I held my nose and mouth closed so the air had nowhere to go. I did not see rainbows. I pushed as hard as I could over and over for a few minutes with not having much room for the air to escape.  Since I am not there, hypothetically speaking what kind of damage could have occured from all of this? I've heard others online say things like herniated sinus, damage to vagus nerve, cranial damage, etc. I've also heard people say its just anxiety or I'm over reacting, but my eyes become bloodshot after bending over, that's a direct physiological response, I don't just have anxiety. Could my brain be swelling for some reason after bending over causing the red eyes? I would like to know what to tell the doctor or what kind of tests I should have. I'll be seeing a physical therapist in a month for my back, I'll tell him about the head or nasal issues.  Symptoms: These can last the whole day, part of the day, or a short time.  When I bend over forward or tilt my head too far (other triggers too see below) my eyes become red and burn, vision a little blurred. I feel pain somewhere I think in my nasal cavity. I feel like there is some kind of unequal pressure in my head and pain as I move it around like my brain is swollen or it feels like I have painful moving slight water logged head. It becomes a lot harder to think, foggy thinking. I have difficulties remembering things. Decreased cognitive ability. While its happening I have a lot less energy, my heart feels stressed if I try to run while feeling like this, I feel a throbbing sensation in my fingers and other places. Sudden or inconsistent sounds and or lights feel like they are ""grabbing"" at my heart or cause a little pain in my head. Some kind of slight epilepsy? (I also had a head injury a little before then see below) I think I've had a couple of small seizures. I feel like I need to keep my head as level as I can and can't tilt it past a certain point. When my eyes turn red I also feel a strong sensation of my pulse at the tips of my fingers and increased awareness of my heartbeat, but the doctor says everything about my heartbeat is normal. I feel a throbbing sensation in other parts of my body too.  Also when laying down I get tiny air bubbles that trickle out of one of my nostrils making a tick, tick sound, even when I hold my breath, doesn't seem to be coming from my lungs. Not sure if that's related. When it goes back to feeling mostly normal and I feel better, my head still feels ""not solid"" and feels like I need to avoid bending over. I think I've also had a couple of small seizures, I fainted once in the bathroom and when becoming conscious again it was like my arms were locked together.  Symptom Triggers: Some are stronger than others. Pushing when pooping or farting. Tilting my head too far. Bending over. Breathing through my nose or blowing my nose. Swallowing. Sucking. Sneezing. Also sudden or inconsistent sounds or flashing lights feel like they are ""grabbing"" at my heart or cause pain in my head.  ----- Now years later with a possible back injury, when walking I feel pain in my heels (does not radiate throughout legs) each time I feel pain in my heels I feel a corresponding pain in my head. It seems like Sciatica from what I've read, except Sciatica doesn't radiate to the head. Rolling my heels slightly, or being on uneven surfaces feels like it pinches my heels and at the same time causes a pinching pain feeling in my head and each step triggers some or all of the above symptoms temporarily or for longer time.  Not sure if this has anything to do with it, I didn't feel different after this even, but also when about about 10 years old I was riding my bike in the street and I got knocked out, I remembered something about a lady saying something like ""Its your fault!"" I think I got hit by a car. I came home, later people told me for a few hours I didn't know who my family was and then I went to sleep for a few hours and woke up normal. They didn't take me to the ER or doctor for that either. I had scrapes on my body including my head. No scar or stitches from that. Broken bike though.  Considering all of the above, I have many symptoms and many theories. Could part of my brain be getting pinched in a crack in my cranium? Could my brain be swelling for some reason? Could I have a hernia in my nasal cavity somehow? How could that affect my brain? What connects my heels to my back and my head? I'm not sure.",

What I and others are experiencing around this topic is unrelated and has no correlation to anxiety. Anybody who says it is not going through this, is being hard headed and as well in a hurry to jump to a conclusion. Yes the symptoms include anxiety but it is not the root cause of the problem. Unfortunately when bringing up this topic with most health care ""professionals"" they just write it off as. I first started noticing the effects of this pathogen three years prior, (mid of 2015) as well as remembering controlling the entirety of my body & being completely healthy. So far roughly around every single doctor or neurologist I have went to in my area has assumed I have been incorrect about my hypothesis about my self diagnosis or to go as far and call me delusional. With regard to whether anybody believes me or not is not of my interest but to dispute and to further archive my self diagnosis is my main concern. The brain stem is connected directly to the tongue, which is therefor essential for most of the motor functions of the human body. Now to say that if saliva embedded with pathogenic bacteria could make its way from the tongue, to the brain stem, to the peripheral nervous system, to basically spread to parts of the brain could it? The head tremor started when I felt my neck snap in certain places. It was a rather disgusting sound I felt. I feel as though as there are nerves on the back of my neck crawling, running up to my head. At times rising to the sides of my head, extending to my frontal lobe. It is followed by deterioration and tremor of the vision, cognitive impairment, consistent nightmares and other serious issues. I remember scouring the Internet for drugs that could possibly reverse the initial effects of the tremor. I came across Trazodone. I will vouch for this drug 100% My saliva is indeed the root cause of all of this. Within the first initial week of taking the drug my saliva regenerated, became thick again and every single part of my body became free of any sort of tremor.  Unfortunately for me I ended up distorting my sleep schedule which ultimately ended up (no idea how) slimming my saliva back down to this cottony, weak texture. With that brought back the tremor. Saliva in all cases tells how healthy person is. If it is thick and sticky that usually means a person is fine and healthy. If it is vice versa, generally the person is not. I'm certainly most likely experiencing a case of nerodegeneration. To make things worse my family and personal doctor think I am making this up and do not believe me. Adding to the palm to the face I have no money for an MRI or ""decent"" health insurance. I have been reading studies about the drugs Trazodone and Dibenzoyl methane to possibly slow the effects of the spreading disease. Taking the first medication I can say it indeed does but does not eliminate it.  I argue that this was passed orally and is slowly worsening . I am certain it is a pathogenic bacteria but not entirely sure. To reiterate my intention is to archive my findings and possibly to spread awareness. Let me also say there are more people than me going through this. This is a severe issue that I will not label as just anxiety. the image uploaded shows parts of the brain affected. To go into detail, the red areas that I've circled are parallel to the health issues. The vision / eye tremor being caused by infected optical lobe, tremor on the face being caused by the infected facial nerves. ect.... Pretty much my entire body is subjected to it. The bacteria or pathogen is slowly spreading across the brain. Yes I am absolutely terrified. By next year I can be put in a state of dementia and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it unless I can get the help i'm in dire need of.  No I am not over analyzing my situation. Reason why my personal doctor does not believe me is because he says impossible to be transmitted anything via saliva . I may look normal when you see me but I feel a tremor on my brain stem and twitch constantly. Feelings of depression hit even harder than they used to.I heard phage treatment may be an answer and I am willing to spend the rest of my money on it, but I have no way of knowing how to diagnose myself. I can't get that kind of treatment unless I get a diagnosis that shows what is wrong. A blood test shows my white cell count normal. Unless the location I went to get my testing done did not correctly run my information , to be honest I am lost. I would not be pressing this issue if there wasn't anything wrong with me.","Parkinson's Disease , Alzheimer's Disease"

So let me start by saying im 19and have beem healthy all my life i used to get dizzy spells sometimes at a young age but nothing like how ive been feeling for a while now. About 6 months ago i began have bad heart palpitations and dizzy spells and not being able to drive at certain points because i would have panic attacks and feel like i was going to faint behind the wheel. Following that i was put on betablockers and have been back and fourth to doctors and cardiologists for months doing stress tests, being on heart monitors, echocardiograms and ekgs that all came back normal but i still feel myself getting these irregular and extremely fast heart rates when i sit up or lay down (mostly worse at night) and definitely increase with anxiety. A few months went by and the betablockers seemed to help a little so i just assumed i had terrible anxiety but come this past february i was sitting eating dinner going about my normal day and suddenly i couldnt focus on anything and i felt like i couldn't remember any short term things and i felt weak and i got up went to the bathroom and went and layed down on my bed and suddenly everything went black and the next thing i remember was my mom shaking me and asking me what happend i woke up and was llaying in a pile of blood on my pillow and felt extremely hungover and completely confused as to what happened. My mom didnt see what happened to me because i was in my room but she immediately took me to the hospital and the did many tests including a CT scan an MRI artery valve ultra sounds blood tests and xrays and everything came back normal. Prior to all of this for about a week or two before this ""seizure""the doctors in the hospital told me i had , i had been experiencing horrible headaches id have to sleep off that would be throughout my whole head with sharp pains and into my ears. My ears also sometimes ring and feel clogged and ache and also i get pins and needles in my finger tips and toes once in a blue moon still to this day and same with the headaches. So from there on out i stayed at the hospital over night where they released me the next day and ordered an eeg test to have done. My neurologist got results back a few days later after they conducted the test for about 15 minutes and he called saying i had temporal lobe epilepsy and he started me on keppra and lamictal twice a day already on topof the beta bockers i already take and birth control i just started. Because i feel like my symptoms are getting worse including the headaches extreme dizziness earaches ,suttle confusion at times and worsened anxiety i went to get a second opinion at a doctor who i thought to be very intelligent and after hearing my symptoms and episodes ive been experiencing for months told me i may not have epilepsy at all considering ive only had the one seizure and no one even saw it happen. So for now im decreasing the amount of epilepsy medications im on and instead of taking two ill be taking one eventually (the lamictal) and hes going to be runing other tests including a second mri to make sure its not something they missed reading it the first time, more blood testing, a table tilt test because he thinks i may have POTS an ansar test and a 24 hour eeg to actually prove of theres abnormalities and any signs of epilepsy. With all of this my current fear day in and day out for on going months upon months now is that i have a brain tumor and its causing me to be extremely stressed and anxious all day and night because im scared i might die and waiting for test results and having follow up appointments woth all of that is making me slowly go insane because im just so scared for my health that i have cancer right now. So if anyones out there that maybe has ever felt the same way or a doctor that can maybe read this and help me or comfort me in anyway till i fet results back it would be highly APPRECIATEd because its making me so terrified all day everyday and its hard for me to focus on work school and relationships and i wish i just had answers thank you for anyone who toom the the time to read this i just want to feel better....:(","Epilepsy/Seizures , Caregiving"

At that point when I try to urinate, it burns alot and the urine comes out very very slowly. After it is empty there is a slight feeling of relief, other than that the only time it doesn't hurt is laying on my back. I am also constipated, I have not eaten much since the surgery out of fear.

It started as a spasm which we thought would go, we ended up in A&E and they sent him away with pain killers and advice to ice the area. He works at a hospital as an occupational therapist and has been seeing one of the physiotherapists in his department. He had an MRI which showed no bulging or slipped discs but has continued to be in a lot of pain. He had a few months off work while waiting for an MRI at their request because his pain was too intense to handle normal work and for their own health and safety policies. He has now been back in work for a few months but has found this very difficult. He has seen a number of GPs who have prescribed him different pain killers. He is relatively fit and used to go to the gym on a regular basis. He has not being going to the gym for a while but has followed every bit of advice from the Physio in regards to exercises and strengthening. He was told at one point that it was muscle pain (his psoas muscle needing strengthening) and has also been told that it could be scheuermanns disease (oddly shaped vertebrae) . He was referred to the pain team who have also tried to help with pain management and has been going to work based counselling (not for the pain, but for tools around how to efficiently use your time etc).  He went to see a physiotherapist privately who suggested that while he still had joint tightness and significant pain, that he might be suffering with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. They suggested that he needs to break the pain loop and that he needs to do gentle enough exercise so as to not hurt the area and reaffirm the pain loop. We've now bought an exercise bike that he's been using gently. He went to his GP recently who sent away for a number of blood tests which we are waiting for the results of.  He also suffers with depression and has miraculously held it together until this point, but the frustration of not knowing it taking its toll and he's finding it very difficult to remain focused and positive. He's trying to present himself as capable in work however the patience of the team seems to have run thin now that there is no diagnosis and only lingering pain. He feels like a burden in work and feels as though he will lose his job soon. He feels like a nuisance to the health professionals who mainly tell him to take paracetamol or ibuprofen and don't dig any deeper.

I am 28 years old and my grandfather is 72. He recently has been exhibiting memory problems.  Examples include: asking me a question and starting a conversation with me and then asking the same question again 2 more times by the end of the day, going to the grocery store and not remembering what he needed (my grandma gave him a list, he went to the store, was gone for over an hour, then returned with a pound of deli meat and told my grandma that he lost the list and couldn't remember what he was doing at the store), calling Best Buy (Geek Squad) to fix the computer and then forgetting what company he called to come fix it (he had spoken to Best Buy on the phone about 3 times that day, but couldn't remember who he called), he tried to drive to the Department of Motor Vehicles following verbal directions my grandmother gave him but he forgot where he was going and spent hours driving around before coming home (the next day my grandmother gave him written directions but he lost them and returned home again saying that he couldn't remember where to go - he has been to this DMV before) ...  These behaviors are simply NOT like him. He is usually very sharp and even witty during conversations. My grandfather has not seen a doctor more than twice in the 28 years I've been alive. He hates doctors and tells us that if he ever needs a doctor for anything to just let him die. Due to this fear of doctors, he has not and will not see a doctor for his memory problems. He admits that he is having memory issues, and seems concerned, but will not take steps to figure out the cause.  My grandfather has been an alcoholic since before I was born and is a daily marijuana smoker. I though that maybe these were to blame, but my mom told me yesterday that both of my grandfather's parents exhibited similar symptoms leading up to the day they died. We don't know the exact cause of their deaths and my family often says ""they got old, their bodies began to shut down, and they died in the hospital"".  I'd like to know what these memory loss symptoms could be. I really wish he would see a doctor, but he simply won't. Does anybody recognize these symptoms?",Alzheimer's Disease

I had foot surgery and was incapacited with a foot cast. To get around I was given crutches and had used the crutches for 2 months before I graduated to the walking boot. Due to the cast, the uncomfortable posture, and sleeping in bed with a huge cast, my spine and whole body was mis-aligned. I first went to a chiropractor who manipulated and adjusted me into proper alignment. But I was having numbness in my left arm all the way down to the ring finger and little finger. Tingling, numbness in the arm, and a ""crick"" in the neck.  I went back to the chiropractor for a 2nd adjustment, and again it re-aligned my spine...but did not relieve the pain. I continued to read up on this condition, and thought it was ulnar nerve problems. I decided to see an Osteopathic physician which turned out great decision. He determined that the nerve which exits the C-6 to C-8 vertebrae area and passes thru the shoulder and down into the elbow was not ""pinched"" by the vertebrae, but constricted due to the muscles in the neck-shoulder area. Called Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. The Osteopathic physician's method of adjustment was tender and uses muscle resistance to re-align the area as compared to the Chiropracters violent and sudden movement. Plus the Osteopath took much more time to actually diagnose the problem.   It has taken a visit once a month for the past 3 months to resolve. And a nerve takes up to 5-6 months or possibly 1 year to re-generate the feeling. Also I lost strength in the forearm and dexterity in the fingers by about 75% so I am back at the gym lifting weights to strengthen the forearm. The strength and dexterity in each finger is tested by squeezing a blue racketball throughout the day until the grip strength returns.   Although this was not life-threatening, it would be un-forseeable to have known that the use of crutches would have caused so much mis-alignment of my body and these subsequent issue.","Chronic Pain , Neck Pain"

I am a young woman who was diagnosed with POTS since September of 2017. It took a very long time to get this diagnosis but has me questioning the diagnosis along with another reputable doctor. I am convinced it could be a CFS leak- based on my symptoms and findings. Hear me out and I’d love feedback if this could sound like it.  My first baby was born in 2014. Prior, I had been healthy, very active and fit; a gym rat. I had an epidural which worked well. Came out of that birth fine with some minor back pain, got back to getting fit and was in the best shape of my life.  Feb of 2016, I fell pregnant again and the back pain really started up, where I had gotten my epidural over a year earlier. I saw a spinal specialist who couldn’t do much because I was pregnant. I had an extremely rough pregnancy, had home health care, very sick. Had another epidural, it was botched. I felt almost everything and it mostly numbed my right side. Coming out of that birth was rough. I started having worsening spine pain, headaches, tremors, nausea. I was convinced I had a spinal tumor. An X-ray showed nothing of my spine. I then was diagnosed Hashimoto’s, my thyroid was out of whack. I still continued to suffer from horrible headaches, tachycardia, exercise intolerance and the nausea is constant. All day, every day. That along with the horrendous fatigue, it’s hard to manage my children.  I was diagnosed with POTS and kept having horrible headaches, more like very horrible head pressure. With a family history of aneurysms, they did an MRI/MRA. The imagine showed nothing but it was very much there. I had a “seizure” (in quotes because it was not). I thought I was having a TIA, I stiffened up and started convulsing. Prior to this moment, I was feeling like I was going out of my body, I couldn’t say any words, I couldn’t move, I was frozen but very aware. I was shaking and had a horrible headache. My husband called 911 and it took me to the nearest hospital. They did a CT without contrast which showed no migraine, no seizure, no stroke. I was very happy about that but it didn’t explain what just happened. I was so scared. The neurologist brushed it off as POTS, called it a clonic seizure intractable (HCC).  I saw Dr. Jaeger, the director of autonomic disorders at Cleveland Clinic. He was the one who signed off on my tilt table test and he said it wasn’t impressive and didn’t show POTS, but my neurologist is going off of my symptoms and the poor man’s tilt table he did in his office. My neurologist said “if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a duck”, referring to my POTS. Dr. Jaeger is very well known in the autonomic/cardiology world and he doesn’t think I have POTS. Is it possible that I might have a CFS Leak due to my epidurals? I watched a stanford doctors video about a few women who were diagnosed with POTS, but they actually had CFS leak.  If I lay down, the pressure isn’t as horrible, but still there. The second I stand up, I get a splitting headache, horrible head pressure, mostly in the base of my skull but also goes to the front, a lot in my in temples. The pressure can get so unreal, I have to keep opening my jaw- like how you would on an airplane to relieve the pressure. It makes me nauseous, sometimes my vision gets weird, and I get overstimulated/light sensitive. It also feels like there’s burning in my head? These are not migraines either. The pressure also seems to worsen if I’ve lifted weights in the gym. I can feel it start up in the gym, with the base of my skull brewing with heavy pressure and then when I’m done at the gym, I feel as if my head could explode, popping off from my temples. I’m at a loss. I’m sick of going to the doctors. I’m sick of trying to figure out what’s wrong with me. Something IS very wrong and it is affecting my life very badly.",

I feel drunk, off balance, fuzzy vision. Lightheaded, but have never passed out. My symptoms are very random. I can't seem to pinpoint what brings them on.  Last year I had an abnormal mri. The neurologist seems to think I had a small stroke, a few lesions showed up, but were much smaller at my second mri. I have been tested for lupus, ms and tons of other stuff. All tests come back fine.  My other symptoms include: tension headaches, nausea, diarrhea, stiff neck, head pressure, numb/tingly feeling on sides of face up thru my scalp, sometimes shaky feeling on the inside.  I have been reading about basilar migraines and I'm wondering if this could be a possibility. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms?",

My head was moving from left to right rapidly and its unstoppable for me.  I would say as a seizure but when i went to emergency and described my situation . Doctor said it can't be seizure according to my explanation as i also said i am conscious at that moment. so he didn't recommended CT scan. i got my blood work , EKG , everything is fine but they said they don't know why that episode happened. i felt so weak and dizzy after that . i often almost pass out like three times a day for 7 days. i don't pass out now but too dizzy in the morning time. i also can't manage anything except going to restroom and doing simple things. one of my doctor friend suggested to drink 10 gatorades a day (as she thought it caused due to electrolyte imbalance) so i had those for six days. seventh day i had to rush to ER for severe heartburn because of gastritis, apparently caused due to high level of gatorade consuming.  on the other hand i take contraceptives , metformin and spironolactone for my PCOS. after this incident i quit metformin and spironolactone. i started a new tablet sheet of contraceptives, days before the incident happened. in these days i made a note and checked that on three different days with ON and OFF conditions. i experienced worse dizziness and fainting when it is ON. i was on APRI for five months now. so according to me i think all this happened because of APRI ( contraceptive). i have to visit OB GYN sometime this week. i am unemployed and don't have proper insurance. Please suggest what to do. P.S - i am not Hypoglycaemic by the time that episode happened. checked in glucometer it was 105mg. i also do some sort of heavy work out.",Epilepsy/Seizures

It took about 16 months from the time I was diagnosed until I was released from PT services. I did PT during the freezing stage mostly for pain management. I also started with Tylenol #3 and moved to #4 for medication. I also discovered Biofreeze which gave a little relief.  Now my left shoulder is going through the same thing and again it is idiopathic. I started feeling symptoms in late January and recognized what it probably was in late February. I was officially diagnosed when I went for my first doctor visit on April 4. I go back to see my doctor on June 6th. Tylenol #4 already isn't doing much for the pain. Lately I've needed 2 pills to make a dent in my pain. I have so many more months to go before this is over. That is a bit hard to deal with.

Pain Management,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/pain-management/3700/advice-for-years-of-lower-and-middle-back-pain,Advice for years of lower and middle back pain.,"Hello. For at least 8 years now I have had back pain that has gotten too much to bare. The main issue is my lower back and feels like a slipped disc pressing on a nerve, but it doesnt go down my leg. It feels like the left and right sides of the lowest part of my spine. It gets so bad sometimes that I have to lean my body to the left because I cant straighten it out without severe pain. This pain comes and goes and has no real rhyme or reason. Sometimes its when I first wake up, other times its in the middle of the day like right now. The other pain happens in the middle of my back and seems to come when I have been standing too long. This also is on the left and right of the spine in the middle of my back. This pain also comes and goes, but will almost always happen in I have done some sort of project where I have been standing for awhile. This one might have a lot to do with being out of shape. I am a 5'11"" male, 42 years old, and about 228 last time I was weighed. I am currently exercising and eating better to get this weight down in hopes it alleviates some of the pain, and just to be in better shape. But I doubt the disc issue will be resolved just by getting in shape, but might improve.   I dont have a primary doctor at the moment, but I have called the local orthopedic surgeons office in hopes of getting some help. I know I should have gotten some help for this a long time ago, but there is a reason why Id rather not get into. My question is this. If it is indeed a slipped/ herniated disc will it show up in an MRI if the disc isnt slipped when they do it? Is there some other sign that will show that the doctor will be able to verify? I am 99% sure its slipping based on the way it feels like its pinching a nerve, but have read that this usually also causes shooting pains down the leg, which is not the case with me.  Anyway I thought I would post here for any advice or info someone might have. Thank you in advance.","Chronic Pain , Back Pain"

The Next day 2 days after the lightheadedness I started to know feel dizzy and nauseous and had quite a bit of neck pain the lightheadedness turned onto a full out headache. The next day now 3 days after the initial symptoms the dizziness and nauseau and neckpain got worse and I now had a fever around 104. On the 4th day the headache and other symptoms continued and my glands under my mouth were slightly enlarged. On the 5th day the fever was still going strong and the headache was extremely bad (not going to lie I cried a bit from the pain) it might be worth noting that I had no cough nor was my sinus in pain and no runny nose. The symptoms here continued for two-three more days before the fever supsides all in all it lasted about 1 week. At the end I was salivating like crazy like much much more than I have ever with other illnesses. I started to feel a bit better but the pain in my upper back where I can just reach if I put my hand back, aswell as I was extremely tired still and had a headache pretty much constantly that felt the worse around the back of my head and neck meets. I also had a rash on both of my elbows. I felt like it was hard to concentrate and had trouble sleeping even though I was extremely tired. I went back to work and had alot of trouble doing my job and concentrating so I went to the clinic now about 10 days after the symptoms started and 3 days after they ended. He suspected I had mono however the blood tests said otherwise so just moved on. About a month later now I am still feeling the headache in the back of my head and upper back pain aswell as neck pain. I also feel quite weak in my legs and kinda always feel like I'm going to fall over, like when riding the subway I used to be able to easily ride without holding on and today I was holding on for dear life and nearly tipped over 10 times. I wouldn't mind the pain but the headache is the worst because I have trouble thinking straight and sleeping, and I almost fall over every time I get up. Getting 9+ hours of sleep doesn't even feel like enough when before I could easily get away with 6. So I went back the the clinic and told him my symptoms that I still had and he recommended I went to ER for whatever reason. So I ended up going and I got a CT scan and more blood tests and they turned out to be Normal apparently. And I was released with no more information. It's been 4 days since then and I've tried to focus on keeping good posture and sleep straight on my back just incase it was some muscular issue, but it hasn't seemed to help at all. I know it's a far cry but if anyone has any idea whats going on or has had a similar experience or and thoughts o would greatly appreciate it. Thank you and sorry for the wall of text :(",

Our truck was sent flying and spinning off the highway, reduced to rubble. I was not wearing a seat belt and got tossed around in the backseat. It was a miracle we survived.  After getting some MRIs done I found out I had a massive arachnoid brain cyst (the size of an orange). It's benign. I was born with it. The cyst ruptured during the accident and leaked brain fluid, creating loads of pressure inside my head.  The hospital wouldn't perform surgery until I presented dangerous symptoms (not sure why). The pressure eventually grew greatly, breaking some blood vessels and filling my head with blood. That sent me straight to the hospital.  I was experiencing splitting headaches, double vision, vomiting, and weakness/tingling in my legs. They fenestrated the cyst and drained the fluid.  Over the following weeks and months I recovered very well.  However, from time to time I still experience episodes of growing pressure inside my head, headaches, fogginess, and some double vision.  I also noticed a spike in muscle stress around my head / face area. I'm grinding my teeth heavily at night. I'm squeezing and tightening my neck muscles throughout the day without realizing. I'm also experiencing some nervous tics around my eyes. Sometimes I can't stop twitching them, to the point that they hurt and my eye lid quivers on its own.  By the end of each week my entire head and face feel fatigued.  At first I thought these would go away on their own. But now it's been almost two years since surgery and I'm still experiencing this. My biological father was diagnosed with mild Tourettes in his late 30s. I've never been tested myself.  I have never posted on a medical forum before, and I've always tried to manage these symptoms on my own. But now it's getting to the point that I need some advice.  I'd like to stay away from presciption medications as much as possible. I've considered maybe trying medical marijuana to allieviate some of these symptoms. But I've never tried it before and am unsure if I even qualify for a medical card. Any advice would be helpful. Thank you.",

For example, he walked out of a restaurant with a food tray in his left hand after emptying the trash. He will use his phone, but then not put it down, then struggle to use that hand in opening the newspaper because that hand has a phone it (and he is completely unaware of the phone).

I am new to these boards and come seeking advice. I have a close friend who is narcoleptic. He has been so for many years now. Throughout these many years he has tried many different medications, all have worked to some extent or another BUT all have ended up making him sick. Why? This is because he has a rare allergy to an ingredient that is found in a lot of common pill-form medicines. The exact name escapes me at this moment but I think it's something along the lines of Titanium Dioxide. These medications always end up getting him bladder infections.  Just in the last year he was suggested Xyrem by doctor, and as far as I know, it did help him to control his sleeping and he got better for a short period of time, however ... after a couple of months this medicine ended up getting him horribly depressed (part of the known side effects I am guessing) and he has actually had to go on anti-depressants. Unfortunately, the anti-depressants have had minimal effect in out-weighing the Xyrem. He has been struggling for the better part of the last 6 or 7 months with his narcolepsy, Xyrem and his anti-depressants. Nothing seems to work for him and he cannot seem to break himself from the funk he is currently in. The drugs together seem to be turning him into a zombie. As far as I know, he's already seen a couple of different doctors regarding the situation, but I have no idea how those visits have gone. I am fearful for his mental health at this point and am wondering if anyone else has any experience with a situation like this?  Does anyone know any good specialists in the surrounding Columbus OH area? Any kind of vitamin or diet techniques that might help?  Any kind of advice, suggestions, or feedback would be helpful.

I never fully returned to my past levels of activity. But overall the surgery seems to have been a success. Example, I quit organized sports but could go about my daily business more or less. In the past two years I have been experiencing discomfort - more recently pain if I stand on it for too long. Even basic and low impact cardio workouts like the stationary bike seem to create discomfort.  I'm curious if others have had similar issues and how they've made out down the road after such an Injury? I am relatively young (40) and am frustrated that even light activities that promote healthfulness such as skipping rope or cycling are causing issues.  My goal is to stay healthy for myself and family but I can't seem to do much without aggravating my knee.  I am wondering if there are any people in the community that have had significant meniscal repairs done and if they have had similar challenges.  If so, what did you do?  Did you improve it through physical therapy?  Have you used supplements?  Did you have to get more surgery?  Did you develop arthritis?  I am also curious what my prospects are for the next hopefully 40 years? Am I definitely facing a knee replacement down the road? My doctor that did the original surgery did a fine job in my opinion but for follow up these days seems to think the repair is holding up (judging via x ray). He is super busy and I am considering a second opinion but wanted to hear from others how they have been coping. I am often down in the dumps that there is so little I can do without feeling set back - including playing w my kids.  Thanks,  AG",Knee Pain

Ever since for the past 5 months it has not fully gone away. Every morning it starts off very dull and thought out the day is varies on intensity, some days are worse than other and sometimes it remains very tolerable.  My first visit to my doctor was for a regular physical and some blood test, everything was good; the only thing was that my liver enzymes were a little elevated, but overall there was nothing alarming. The Doctor gave me ibuprofen to alleviate the pain, after taking them for 4 days I stopped since it was no working.  I took a CT SCAN w/o contrast to the brain, again nothing irregular, for most part of April, I went to two different chiropractors thinking it was my neck/back that was pinching a nerve causing pain to the head, they even worked on my jaw muscles to see if anything was wrong in that area. After the month of April was over I figured I had to find another explanation because nothing seen to make it better.  I went to the dentist and they recommended me to use a mouth guard since there were sings of teeth grinding and jaw clinching, to this day I use them every night but that seems to not be the cause. Also went to get my eyes checked, but everything was good, although I was told that my eyes were very dry, so they prescribed FLUOROMETHOLONE 0.1% drops to take care of that, again; no signs that it caused the pain. I took them for two weeks and then moved on. Went back to my doctor, had another blood test, only to have the same results. I went on to take an MRI w/o contrast to the brain, and a few weeks later went to a Neurologist 06/01/2016. The MRI showed some “abnormalities of the posterior right periventricular white matter, representing a small area of “encephalomalacia/gliosis. The sequel of periventricular leukomalacia would be one possible etiology.” Based on that he prescribed AMITRIPTYLINE HCL- 10 MG TABLET, and FLURBIPROFEN- 50MG, those were for muscle/mood relaxing, and inflammatory pain reliever. He also recommended for me to see an Ear, Nose and Throat doctor to see if the pain was caused by a possible sinusitis problem. As told; I went there, he he checked my mouth and inside my nostrils. There were no sign of any sinusitis and I was back to square one. Its been 5 moths now and I cant find any clue as to what can be causing this tension headaches. The pain varies as far as the location (sometimes is on top, side, back of the head). As far as the intensity of the pain, it is very random (some days are very intense and other are very mild/dull). On 07/07/2016 I had and appointment with my Neurologist again for a month check-up. He did not help at all. I then started to learn/practice trigger therapy, with little results. On 11/01/2016 went in for physical therapy, worked on strengthening my shoulders and neck area. After a month i was release by the doctor because I did not get better. Please I don't know what to do or where to go. If anyone has suggestions or solutions please help me. Email me or text me at : mperez13@email.cpcc.edu and 704-222-3064.",Headaches

My brain seems to quit working too, when I'm really tired. I can't think straight and my fingers fumble when I try to handle things.

I have been in physical therapy for this and my spine but these symptoms are just as bad now as they were months ago, my symptoms have not been alleviated by the physical therapy treatments. I told my surgeon about these symptoms which he completely ignored aside from a CBC to test for anemia. I have since received my records from his office and he didn't record any of the problems I told him about in the appointment notes and in fact said I was doing ""quite nicely"". I had no words after I read that, nothing I would put on here anyway. I also have been having problems with another spot in my spine that has begun to feel like my lower back did prior to my surgery and my PT has been working with me on this as well. I just found out that one of the follow up x-rays showed Spondylosis at another spot in my back which I was not informed of and I suspect it has gotten worse since then based on how I feel. I don't know if all this is connected or not but this is affecting my whole life. I don't leave my house unless I have a scheduled appointment. I can't work or have normal social interactions because of the limitations these symptoms cause.

Everyday since then I have applied Hydrogen Peroxide and antibiotic ointment in an attempt to heal it and prevent infection. When that didn't work I even scheduled an appointment with my doctor where he prescribed me an additional antibiotic ointment.

Furthermore, my pants grind on and off the wound itself, further preventing healing. Showering has the same effect. My question is, what do I do? How can I prevent the wound from ripping when I sleep or wear pants? Will a band aid do it, or will it cut off the air and make it worse? Should I see the doctor again to prescribe some kind of cast?

The symptoms start when I turn my head up, down, or sideways, or when I bend over and blood rushes to my head.  Symptoms include headache, sinus pressure, a feeling of pressure waves that affect my hearing in waves that seem to be in conjunction with my heartbeat, visual disturbance usually flashes in my peripheral or sometimes reduced vision.  I've always had migraines since I was very young. Those were usually related to lack of eating or hydrating or strenuous activity especially in the heat. My neck pain has progressed over the last 10-15 years. I have experienced whip lash a few times while snowboarding (falling down).  The episodes are nearly debilitating and can at times be very painful. Not only that, but the condition is very frustrating because I don't know the cause or how to ease the pain and/or frequency. It will often wake me during the night so that my sleep habits are greatly affected.  Pinched nerve? Brain tumor? What could it be? I don't have insurance, otherwise I would definitely get checked out. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading. ~ Geoff","Chronic Pain , Headaches , Neck Pain , Migraines"

It is always the same smell which is why I know it isn’t anything new. Of course when I say something or ask if anyone smells it they act surprised and say no.

My dad has been having very painful headaches for a year now. They pretty much last all day and he has been taking 3 Advil 3-4 times a day to keep ahead of them. He has seen Primary Doctor, Neurologist, Neuro Surgeon, Ear Nose and Throat Doc, Eye Doctor, has had many MRI, Xrays, Ultrasounds, blood work, etc. All come up clean. His symptoms keep getting worse. Maybe 7 months ago he started complaining about the headaches waking him up out of sleep if he were to lay on his back. Then he said he would turn on his side and they would go away. Then two months ago he started complaining about having double vision if he looked anywhere not straight ahead. Less than a week ago he went to the doctor for results on a plethora of tests he had just gotten done (tests were all clean), and while at the doctor office he lost his memory. Not complete amnesia, but he had no idea what was talked about at the doctors office. He couldn't really put words together to form a sentence. They admitted him to the hospital in the stroke unit (he didn't have a stroke) where he spent 4-5 days and got the typical MRI and blood work. Didn't show anything. He also had an EEG and they checked his carotid. All came up clean. He is now back home still having headaches and still ""Fuzzy"" as he describes since his memory loss incident.  My dad does have a mass in his head. A dermoid cyst. They discovered that over 20 years ago randomly and when compared to MRI today they said it hasn't changed at all in that time period so that is most likely not the cause. All our doctors can do is order MRI tests and refer to other people who just order another MRI and then say ""I dunno"". I am desperate for any other ideas. The doctorsc mentioned something about his excessive Advil use that can cause rebound headaches or something like that. I see where they are coming from, but I don't think that can cause memory loss and double vision. Can it? His symptoms again are awful headaches that change spots, fatigue, double vision, memory loss (blackout?), feeling fuzzy and out of it. We have been referred to an eye neurologist but if that doesn't pan out I think we will be heading to Mayo in Minnesota. Thank you.",

I am a 32 year old male who is pretty active. I don't feel any pain when I'm at the gym.  I went back to school so I am currently a full time student and there was no major traumatic event to cause this pain. I have been waking up throughout the night with pain about 2-3 times a night.  It feels like a constant cramp/throbbing in my low back which radiates to my left hip. I feel the most pain when I sit on the couch or lay down in any position. What I have done: Taken a X-Ray/MRI and both came back ""normal"". Basically my doctor just told me that back pain is common and that my back shows no sign of severity that requires back surgery or injections. I have tried Physical therapy but that did not help either. Currently I am trying acupuncture but that's not helping the pain at all either. I have tried stretching out my hamstrings but that hasn't helped at all either. I have tried different sleeping positions (Sleeping on side with pillow between legs, sleeping on back with pillow under knees) and a different mattress but neither has helped.  I am just at a lost at what I should do now. I do not want to rely on pain killers every night just so I can get a good nights sleep.  Thank you in advance!","Chronic Pain , Back Pain"

Originally the illness started in my right foot/ankle, then spread up my leg, into my hips, up to my shoulders, down my arm, and into my hand. After about a year with my pain management team at the hospital for sick children my pain reduced and was very tolerable. The only place that had pain that was intolerable was my back, but the physicians said it was from carrying around the air cast they had put on my foot (the cast was to increase mobility by applying pressure to try and reduce the amount of swelling). I had the cast on for nearly 7 months. So I understood what they were saying about my back, but they also stated that the back pain should only be there for approximately 3 months, basically until my hips realigned. But now it has been a year and a half since I got the cast off and my back is still hurting, in fact it has gotten a lot worse. I have been going to frequent doctors appointments to try and figure out what is wrong but no one is saying much. I have tried looking on the internet to see if there is any research of CRPS spreading to the back but I haven't found anything.  Does anyone know if it is possible?

His method involves injecting small doses of Vitamin B12 directly on the pain/injury site. He placed them in about 10 places that were giving me trouble/pain.

With it on the lowest setting I felt like I was being electricuted. I complained to the rep every day. On my 3 week check up I begged the monster of a surgeon to take it out.

He finally agreed to take it out 6/7/2016. I AM IN WORSE PAIN THEN BEFORE THE OPETATION. I get bad bruises where the lactamy, lines and battery were put in. I got Guillian Barre Syndrome 1/2010. Now I'm wondering if a stimulator was meant for GBS patients. What I need is a GOOD Lawyer because when my Neurologist saw what he did, he said you know you have a Malpractice Lawsuit? He put the lines in like a snake, not straight. I still get sharp pains and feelings like I'm being stabbed. I can only stand 5 minutes before I'm on the floor curled up in a ball to relieve this unbearable pain. IF ANYONE HAS A GOOD LAWYER, I live in NJ. Please email me. And get this, an attorney called me. I thought my Neurologist gave them my name. They came to my house, read my medical records and asked if they could take them. Stupid me, didn't make copies. I had HANDWRITTEN notes from the surgeon which I would have had a case against him. The lawfirm just so happen to represent the Surgeon and they accidently on purpose destroyed the handwritten medical records. I'm filing with the Bar Association against that lawfirm.

I hit my head last night on the corner of a counter, on the top front just a few inches back from my hairline directly in the center. It left a small bump that is already going down a little. I felt a little foggy afterwards but really didn't notice any major symptoms besides the scalp pain where I hit my head. About four hours later I got extremely tired, given it was 10pm by that point but I was much more tired than usual. I also started having a pressure in my head, like a tension or sinus headache and that pressure was stemming from where i actually hit. The scalp pain also started to spread back to the crown of my head and that seems to be where most of the pain/bruise is now and today that scalp pain/bruise is worse. it's very tender and bruised that I can tell and I understand that being normal. What I'm worried about is the pressure headache and the migraines. The headache is acting like a migraine, it goes away or fades with rest and sleep and then comes back and worsens with activity, watching tv, reading, etc. The pain is mostly at the local spot where I hit and then in the back of the head along with the pressure that's all over.  I'm not having any other symptoms related to concussion or serious head injury. No confusion, slurred speech, dizziness. I've had some nausea, mostly last night. The migraines I would say range in intensity from mild to moderate. The pressure is worse when I lay down and better when I'm standing or sitting up.  Is this sort of headache normal for just a superficial bump on the head? I hear all these horror stories about bleeding and clotting and I know I shouldn't read those but they kinda scare me! I should also say that I'm very prone to migraines and have reoccurring tension headaches almost half the time.

I looked through WebMD and it will be my first time posting. I'm from Malaysia, and I pretty much carry a lot of problems with me, literally. I have severe allergic rhinitis since I was a kid, currently 24. It was always a problem for me as I would always have to spit out my phlegm every few minutes. When I was 22, there was a serious case of haze that happened for months and I had a severe fever.  When I recovered, suddenly my legs were feeling very itchy, and it just wouldn't go away. At the end, I was not able to sleep for 10 days and I became suicidal. I was really lucky to be saved, not to go into detail but I was still very sick. I don't even get phlegm anymore, instead it was blood. Antihistamine made my legs worse and I still didn't know I had RLS.  I went to many doctors of GP, neurologist and psychiatrist. Did a bunch of test like nerve conduction and etc, but nothing. I live in Malaysia, so the medical technology was obviously not as advanced as the western countries. Then, I went to a local neurologist and she managed to diagnose that I have RLS. I was eating Sifrol, I think it differs from other brands but it's medicine for Parkinson's. It worked well initially but I had to increase the dose by a lot.  In the end, I could not afford it and had to go for other methods, which is Chinese acupuncture. It helped a lot, but other problems arise.  Even when many years before I had gotten RLS, I had been a heavy bodybuilder and may have lifted too heavy over the years. I'm not sure if it's related but I think I might have damaged my nerves as well, perhaps known as peripheral neuropathy.  So currently, I will list down my problems that I have. 1. Heart palpitations to the point that sometimes it hurts 2. Unable to pee properly, sometimes I feel I could pee finish or frequently peeing. 3. I became much more clumsy. 4. I still have to spit my phlegm due to allergic rhinitis.  5. My RLS is very serious, sometimes to the point that even the arms and the neck shakes as well.  6. I am unable to focus well. I hope that somebody out there is able to share some info on what I should do as I live in Malaysia, I can't just do any test possible as I have to bear all of the cost.  I have been suffering badly for 2 years now, without able to work or sleep properly.  Thank you for taking your time to read my problem.",Parkinson's Disease

I took different medication (10+) and anti-depressants and even had ECT to get rid of the feeling but nothing helped. Alongside pressure came also eczema, erectile dysfunction and several cognitive issues (loss of memory, foreign languages, focusing).

The day after next I went to get an X-ray (required for work) and the radiologist said it was broken and needed to see a othropedic surgeon. 3 days later, my orthopedic doctor doesn't think it's broken and said it's an ankle and midfoot sprain.

It took us months to get into a GI specialist and they found some 'weird but not abnormal' things and the pain moved from front abdominal (before this) to his kidneys. We've been waiting on the kidney specialist since October but now we have no PCP. We've taken him to the ER multiple times and they determine that his kidneys aren't behing 'right' and he needs to see a specialist, but since we have Medicaid they pretty much just tell us they can't do any more and send us home.

I've been doing a pretty good job with the R.I.C.E. approach to it and have been popping some supplements to help build strength back up. I can bend my knee fine, straighten my leg out and raise it up and down. But there is still some MINOR discomfort and I'm probably at 70% with it.  I've been on the internet reading up and honestly I think it's just a bruised patella or bruised kneecap. Again I'm mobile (I even ran 5 miles last week) but it got kind of aggravated so I'm back to resting it until the discomfort goes away 100%.  Should I keep resting it or do you think I should go to the doctor and get an X-ray? I don't like doctors visits because they always end up hurting the wallet even when I am under United Healthcare.  Any advice will help, again I think this is a bruised knee situation because I can do a lot with it (bend it, raise it, walk normally)..it's just that lingering discomfort that I don't trust yet.

They decided to do a bronchoscope and I didn't come out of the anesthesia. I was put on a ventilator and dialysis for 2 weeks. Needless to say the pain is horrible. The doc in the hospital said that the amount of pain medication I was on contributed to my crashing in the hospital.

I worked in an office for over 2 years that was infested with black mold and aspergillus. I've been sick more times in the past 3 years then I have throughout my entire life. And even while working in that office I suffered an early miscarriage - to be fair, I don't have a clue if mold had anything to do with that but I definitely do wonder because the doctor couldn't tell me what caused it.  I've been out of that environment since the middle of May 2017 but still experiencing symptoms (brain fog, memory loss, other cognitive issues, digestive problems, random dizziness, severe fatigue, passing out multiple times, etc.) and for the past several months I've had pretty strange menstrual irregularities, such as being late (like a week late) every month for several months, periods only lasting 2 days, bleeding between periods, etc. I'm not pregnant so that isn't the cause and just last week I was told that I have several ovarian cysts on both of my ovaries. Does anyone know if prolonged exposure to both of those molds could have caused these menstrual irregularities and the cysts? Aside from migraines with aura I get once a year, I was completely healthy before I worked in that office, never had issues with my reproductive system, memory, fatigue, nothing! And at most I got sick once or twice a year but while I was there I was sick like every 2 or 3 weeks!! Also, before working there I never had allergies before in my life but while I was in that office I developed horrible allergy issues. Thankfully those have pretty much gone away since leaving that office. Anyway, if anyone knows if prolonged toxic mold exposure can cause reproductive issues like I'm experiencing or knows a direction to point me in please let me know. Thank you!",

Early last year, maybe around may/June 2017 I began experiencing severe pain on and around the heel of my left foot when walking, including a shock of pain from my heel up my leg (possibly one of the most painful things I ve ever experienced) when I accidentally stood on a small pebble or anything on the ground. This was a constant thing for maybe a month or so, which finally died down to pain in my heel after walking for longer than around 20-30 minutes. Since that time this pain has continued to re-emerge after a long ish period of pressure on my heel (mainly walking). However for the past 3-4 months I have developed shocking pains up and down the outside of my left leg that seems to start at random times, not every day but I would estimate I experience it more days than I don t. These shocking pains are in bursts around 5-10 seconds apart and all together last around 10 minutes. Often after these episodes my leg and foot feels tingly and slightly numb.

As it was being done by the anesthesiologist, she could hear the assistant saying it wasn’t working and they did not get the right spot before she was completely sedated for surgery.  She developed a lump on her sternum where the nerve block was done shortly after the surgery, and it is causing her considerable pain when moving her head and neck, reaching for items, etc. We returned to the orthopedic surgeon, and he was at a loss as to what it was. Physiotherapy was suggested, but it did not help; nor did several cortisone shots. However, the physiotherapist suggested it could be scar tissue. She had an MRI, however it was inconclusive.  We returned to the surgeon, and he now believes it is arthritis, and says it is common. It seems odd he was at a loss before, and can now make a diagnosis without any sort of image. Has anyone heard of this or had it happen to them? Any suggestions would be most appreciated. Many thanks.",Chronic Pain

(Involuntary) Tics Becoming too much to bear,"I have had something happen since I was young (around 9-10) where I cycle through different types of tics or spasms. Typically they have been motor manifestations, such as a relentless series of unstoppable jolts of my head in a movement similar to a nod (the one I’m doing right now), or sharply drawing my elbow backward and inward to the point where it hurts my shoulder and makes it feel severely eroded. Others include the sharp sudden clenching of my abdominal muscles or the flicking of my big toe against my second toe out. I have dealt wih these issues for so long and they are beginning to very nearly dominate my life. They always move in a cycle, where I have a period of doing one tic for a long time until I move onto the next one a week or two-four later. It’s always a repetitive action as well. Many of these end up with me feeling great pain toward the end of the tic’s lifespan within that cycle. For instance, I am unable to angle my neck right now without experiencing significant pain. Please help me figure out what is going on with me, as I have no money to visit a doctor without first narrowing down the suspects, so to speak. A small list of personal details that may help: 1. I am 20 years old 2. I am male 3. This seems to act up more when I drink caffeine or when I play video games 4. I don’t play any contact sports that would affect my brain significantly 5. I can suppress it, with great difficulty, if I consciously try to not do it, with all my effort 6. No instances of it occuring in my sleep 7. I got a CT scan which revealed no issue with my brain 8. The majority of the tics revolve around my neck and head, and many require me to hold my breath while I do them Please Help, I am so over living this way",
Sleep,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sleep/2442/complicated-dreams-keeping-me-from-feeling-rested,Complicated dreams keeping me from feeling rested.,"Hey everyone,  This is sort of new to me but wanted to see if anyone has heard of this before. I generally have no problem falling asleep although I have restless nights every now and then. My brain is generally overactive and I struggled with an anxiety and panic disorder but that doesn't usually give me issues with falling asleep. However, lately even though I do fall asleep quickly, my dreams are long and complicated and I can feel that they are making my brain work full force to solve the ""problems"" in them. I wake up exhausted and stressed out as if I didn't sleep at all. Has anyone ever heard of this? Its not really like insomnia because I am sleeping but my brain just won't shut down. What can I do?  I currently am working at my first desk job that is mentally taxing, the dreams I have are usually work related but I don't particularly feel stressed out about my work and I like the challenge. I just need to learn how to tire my brain out or get it to shut down for bed, this is driving me nuts.",
Sleep,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sleep/89224/unrefreshing-sleep-and-tired-all-day-long,Unrefreshing sleep and tired all day long,"I'm 36 years old. Not a typical sleep apnea candidate. 5'8, 155 pounds and quite in shape/muscular. Only a 15"" neck size. Possibly a larger tongue than normal. Since I was in my early teenage years (possibly even before), I've felt exhausted every day no matter how much I slept. Later elementary school and high school was awful for me. I have days when I feel so tired that it seems hard to focus enough to say my words without slurring them or speaking with a lisp. I have never been able to focus enough mentally to feel that I can drive safely, so I haven't. I wake up some mornings with very deep tooth impressions on the sides and top edge of my tongue. I've had all sorts of blood tests and medical checks, including thyroid. All were fine. I had an in-lab sleep study. They noted a 4.7AHI and an 18.1RDI with 50 unclassified breathing events. My SPO2 levels were said to not drop like someone with sleep apnea, yet the sleep doctor said that my scalloped tongue is a classic sign of sleep apnea. I only slept a total of 2.75 hours for the entire night of the study. I had a brain MRI, which showed nothing usual. My ENT doctor requested a CT scan of my sinuses and noted a deviated septum right right-sided spurring and enlarged turbinates. I had surgery for both of those (successful) in July 2018. Still have awful sleep issues. I get 10-12 hours of sleep and wake up feeling like I've had 4-5 with no energy. The sleep doctor said I don't have sleep apnea because I'm 0.3 away from the 5.0 AHI required to officially diagnose sleep apnea. I have wondered if I have UARS or some other sleep condition. I'm waiting on the results to come back from my home sleep study that I requested for myself (didn't need a doctor to schedule it) because I felt like the sleep lab was incompetent in diagnosing me. My sleep efficiency in the in-lab study was noted at 40%. Over the 2.75 hours that I slept for the whole night of the study, I got like 44 minutes of N1 sleep, 86.5 minutes of N2 sleep, 28.5 minutes of N3 sleep and 7.5 minutes of R sleep. I woke up one night a few weeks ago and let out a big gasp for air and my entire body felt tingly all over, but that has only happened one time (that I am aware of, but could be happening more). What else could be causing me to feel so awful? If I sit in my computer chair at home, I'm prone to falling asleep. I also drift while on a city bus or as a passenger in a car. Fortunately, my job is standing up and moving around all day. The sleep doctor told me, ""If you had a desk job, you'd be falling asleep"" but they won't help me get CPAP to try.",Apnea

Brain & Nervous System Disorders,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/37840/frustrated-no-diagnosis,"frustrated, no diagnosis","In October 2016 at the age of 55, I noticed a slight tremor in my thumb, which continued over a period. I went to my PCP, who observed marked cogwheel ratcheting in my right arm, and we both suspected early Parkinson's. The neurologist observed the same thing and said he also suspected PD. Neurologist started me on amantadine. Right after this, I started using estrogen cream for urinary problems. As soon as I started the cream, the stiffness in my right arm went away, as well as the tremor.  My gait, however, continued to be affected, and I was getting slower & slower & shuffling more. I had completely lost my sense of smell, and my digestive system had ground to an almost halt...but the worst symptoms were cognitive. I would get lost while driving in a familiar area. I would have trouble using the intermittent wiper. I would have trouble figuring out how to get my car into D. I could not negotiate any kind of tricky parking. I would forget why I was talking to a person...I started getting good at not panicking and looking for clues about a conversation, and got pretty good at covering my memory lapses. Fast forward to May of 2016. I requested my PCP give me oral estrogen - I wanted to see whether there was an estrogen connection for me. Everything got better. My sense of smell returned. Very slowly, my thinking started to clear. My gait got better.  No other neurologist witnessed the cogwheel ratcheting, and I look really healthy, compared with many of their other patients. They had no interest in my complaints of cognitive difficulty, and basically told me to keep taking antidepressants...the most recent of these neurologists, who is a movement specialist, told me that my symptoms are from menopause.  But every single symptom I have is consistent with Parkinson's or with Parkinson's plus. And by the way, I still take amantadine every day. Since last spring, the physical manifestations of the neurological problems have started to return very slowly, however, my cognition continues to improve. I have every hope that my body will continue to respond to estrogen, and that I can keep my brain in working order. It is MADDENING that no neurologist seems to have interest in my case. I'm not actually looking for a diagnosis (although I would appreciate it if a doctor would suspend judgement and believe what I say). I am looking for a long-term partner to help me with my neurological health. My neurological issues are not from depression or anxiety (although I have both) --- currently, I can usually walk like a normal person if I put my mind to it.  My current issue that is hardest to deal with are leg cramps at night...like nothing I ever experienced previously. The seem to come out of nowhere and affect muscles that I didn't know could cramp like that. I usually take methocarbamol when I have really tight muscles. I like that it does not sedate me (when I take it in the daytime).  But my main purpose in writing here is...does anybody know of a doctor in the New York state or New England area who might be interested in working with me?

It was red and warm to touch also.  Swelling went down, I was left with a mark near my ankle which I thought no more of. Months passed and this ""cut"" still hadn't healed and it was always still really itchy. I was sure it was getting bigger if anything!  Eventually I went to the doctor. I was given cream which he said had the antibiotic in it and to apply it etc etc. I did as told...... Nothing improved.  I carried on regardless but more months passed and still it was the same way. It just wouldn't heal it seemed. It had been about 12 months! Still so itchy wen I took my shoe off or when getting a bath.  I returned to the docs. Was given another tube of cream which had a steroid in and a course of anti biotics. I completed the course, applied the cream..... Still, nothing changed.  Months later again and for some unknown reason I felt a pain in my foot. One that could only be compared to the feeling I had after being stung by the gnat.... The point of pain was on my instep and not the ankle though. I couldn't see anything like a cut, sting, etc! Over the following days the area became more tender, purple red in colour and then itchy!  I went to the walk in centre and left with more cream. applied as told but no change. Concerned as the ankle and instep redness were both getting bigger and practically joining to be one big area rather than two. Back the doctors. This time I was told it was dermatitis!!! Was given strong cream as he put it! A big tub o emulsifier and a referral was made to see a dermatologist.  The wait for an appt to land on my door step was 40 days they said! Two weeks on, no better, infact so much worse! To theorist where my entire foot was red and swollen, it hurt to walk! And my skin felt tight. It was moving up my lower leg! And was seeping something!  Back to the docs, I went to show him my foot and on doing so he saw for him self that my white sock was half damp with a wet Stain from where the area was. It hurt to pull the sock away from my skin which lokedredandroar. He saw this himself!!!!! He saw how swollen it was! He told me he'd try to hurry my Referral through for the dermatologist and also gave me another course of antibiotics as he assumed there was now a secondary infection perhaps!  I left, im half way through this course of antibiotics! Still no appt arrived from the dermatologist! (FYI, ITS BEEN OVER 40 DAYS) AND WORSE STILL IS ITS GONE SO MUCH WORSE! And for some reason my other ankle has started doing the same hang.... Sudden on set of itchiness! Swollen, red, tender, AND NOW IM UNABLE TO WALK! It hurts far too much! My socks are soaking and it feels like my feet and legs have been burnt! They are scarily purple in colour! Massive in size, bumpy things have appeared and no amount of elevation helps very much! Not enuf to stand and walk to the kitchen!  Im scared! Very! I know somethings not right. I mean how can it be! But doctors are giving me creams and sending me away only for it to get worse each and every time.  What am I meant to do????  I have taken pics but can't see anywhere to upload them on this form? Thought pictures might help you understand what I mean when I say it's really bad!  Any kind of advice would be greatly appreciated please.

After the workout i took off my shoe and my socks were really wet, so i took them off and saw a blister on both of my heels. It has been a week now, i still feel pain everytime i walk with shoes because the blister is quite deep and bleeds when going for intensive activities such as playing basketball. At first when i get my shoes on i feel pain but after my feet gets warm pain goes off a bit, but far not completely. Ive been training in pain for a week now and i stopped today, because i want it to heal. However ive been using some gel, sprays and plasters to cover/heal my blister but they didnt helped too much. Everytime i get back from college i see yellow fluid spots on my socks and im worried now because i need to heal it to continue my training. Everytime i walk in shoes i feel pain, i wear double socks, put on some plasters on the wound but they dont help too much. The blister gets covered in some yellow layer. I dont think i have infection in it because the wound around is not red, and hot either, plus theres no pus, its just covered in some yellow layer which (i think) pops when i walk and thats why i see yellow spots on my socks after getting back from college, however thats only my guess, so thats why i am here, to know what should i be aware of and how to heal it faster.

I'm a very healthy and happy 18 year old girl and I mean it when I say it is definitely not anxiety. My doctor ended my visit with listening to my breathing. He asked me to take 3 deep breaths and by the third one I went into a full episode. He called in two nurses and they ran constant vitals as the episode continued. My heart rate was through the roof, blood pressure sky high, and I was sweating everywhere. Everything finally went back to normal as I laid down and that's when the doctor realized maybe it isn't anxiety and rather something that is brought on by physical exertion. This makes sense when I think about past episodes. He is sending me to a neurologist. What could this be",

I've gone back to school to get a masters in Communication. I have focused my thesis research on new behavioral interventions for ADHD children that I hope will increase peer relationships, decrease disruptive behaviors, decrease parental stress and be both child motivating and child monitored.  I am looking for parents who are willing to participate in a completely anonymous 10 min. questionnaire or be interviewed for 15 minutes - no identifying information will be collected/anonymous. I am looking to gather information about:   -parents thoughts and feelings regarding behavior interventions they have used previously  -parents thoughts and feelings about their child's relationship to video game play  -parents thoughts and feelings about using cooperative, multiplayer video game play as a child-led behavioral intervention.

Since July I have been so sick. Before I became sick, I was a healthy and active 24 year old woman who worked out in the gym everyday was a full time college student and worked part time. It all started with me becoming extremely weak, and every time I would stand up I would become very dizzy and my heart would race. I also was very nauseated, would break out into sweats, had body aches and sharp pains that felt like pins and needles sticking me all over. I thought maybe it was my blood sugar so I started to eat more before I went to the gym. When I was at work one day I felt like I was going to faint even though I had ate. I went to the ER and the doctor done a ton of blood work, CT scan of my head, EKG, and a chest x ray. Every thing came back normal except a little bacteria in my urine. The doctor said I was orthostatic because of my heart rate going up every time I would stand up so he gave me a couple bags of IV fluid and sent me home with an antibiotic. I thought my symptoms was due to the UTI, but I was wrong. I went to my family doctor and he done more blood work to check for other things like Lyme's disease and mono. He also ordered an echo of my heart and for me to wear a heart monitor for a month. The echo and blood work came back clear, except it showed I had active mono. This would be the 3rd time I've had mono in my life. Thinking that's why I was feeling this way I was relieved. I continued to wear the heart monitor over the month of August. My symptoms just kept getting worse. I went back to the ER again cause my heart rate was 150 and I couldn't even sleep. They done more blood work and tests, including an abdominal CT scan to make sure my spleen and liver wasn't enlarged due to mono. Everything came back clear. They gave me a coupe bags of IV fluid and some Ativan to help me sleep and sent me home. My symptoms only became worse. I couldn't sleep for days, my heart rate was going up to 200 bpm. My whole body was in so much pain and I began to have burning sensations. After my skin stopped burning, my whole body went numb. It started with my legs going numb and worked its way up my body. I also couldn't taste, smell, or see good. I hardly could put any weight on my legs. I literally had to hold to the walls to even get to the bathroom because I couldn't hardly walk. I thought I was going to die. My body felt like it was shutting down. I couldn't even eat because I was so nauseated. My doctor done more blood work to check for autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. He also checked my cortisol levels. Which all was normal. He ordered an MRI of my brain, and it came back normal. Gradually my sense of feeling, smelling, and taste came back. I still can't feel things like I used to. Nothing tastes the same either. Smells make me nauseated, even if its good smells. My personality as even changed. I can't hardly remember things anymore. I went from being a happy, social, and smart person to someone who has so much anger over everything, can't think or focus and hates to be around people. My hair is also falling out bad. All my friends and family think I'm crazy and its just anxiety and depression, but I know something bad happened to me. I still feel horrible and weak all the time. I can't hardly get out of the bed. If anyone has any answers to my symptoms, please help me!",

Allergies,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/allergies/85236/butter-intolerance,Butter intolerance,"Okay so I’m trying to get to the bottom of this and it is beyond annoying.  On March 26,2007 I was diagnosed with osteomyelitis (staff infection) in my right ankle. I was given an immediate pick line(left arm)) for internal injections (saline, cytosine & heparin). I did not leave the hospital for about 2 weeks. Finally I came home. Crutches for 6 weeks, pick line for 6 months. A nurse would come to the house to clean/change the bandages around the pick line.  (I also had ADHD and I have been on medicine since the 2nd grade. I have been on aderall XR 30mg since 2008.) In 2010 I had really bad acne so I decided to go on izatretinoine ( acutane). Since I’m a female I took this for 5 months, orally. Acne went away and hasn’t been back :)! In 2011, I had a horrible allergic reaction to Methylisothiazolinone, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, polyquarnium-10/20 & all sulfa’s. I order to find this out I had to get allergy tested. My skin had massive rashes on it, especially my face. It was like raw skin and hurt so bad. I needed a lotion steroid to calm it down. Mind you, Pantine pro-v has all these ingredients in it. I was also losing the hair on the right side of my head. So I unfortunately had to cut my hair short in order to get both side to grow evenly, including a shampoo and conditioner change. :( Was this allergic reaction caused because of the acutane ?? Did it weaken my immune system? I know it messes with your liver sightly..:( In 2015, my boyfriend, friends and I went to Cancun, Mexico. Personally it was my first time leaving America. Had a good time. One of the days we were on vacation my boyfriend had eaten what we thought was a “hamburger” and he got perfusly sick for 12 hours. Throwing up nothing but clear liquids. He was 100 percent better the next day. Now I wasn’t feeling to good this next day. I felt like I had to poop but I was legitimately peeing. It was like every 10 minutes. I had never experienced anything like that before I was like oh it’s just the food being different. Everything at our hotel was filtered, so I wasn’t too worried. On our way home from Mexico, April 11th, all of us were literally s***ing our pants because we finally had American food. Our bodies were adjusting.  For the next month my stomach wasn’t right and it hurt so bad where I would have explosive diarrhea, perfuse sweating ( I would need a change of clothes) and horrible stabbing stomach pains. I would just cry because it hurt so much. I finally go to a GI and they sent me in for all the tests when you reach 50 years old... this is all over the time frame of a year so now we are in 2016... All my tests came back negative and I was pissed because I’m like how the F*** can’t they find anything wrong with me!!! I felt like a guenie pig or a lab rat!  I get a 2nd opinion from another doctor in the middle of 2016. She tells me to take miralax and if it didn’t help for a month to come back. Welp i ended up back there. She has me take a test called the breathe test and it picks up and measures how much Heliocoptor bacteria ( H. Pylori) are in your digestive tract. It finally came back positive and I had to go on antibiotics 580mg for 2 weeks. Then they would measure it again to make sure it was fully gone.  So it is 2019 now and I still have on going bathroom issues like the stools and pains I described earlier. I have tried probiotics, mastic gum, organic foods, changing my diet.... like everything... EVERYTHING. I have been sent home from work because I can’t leave the bathroom. I just feel disgusting and self conscious now because anytime I go anywhere I need to make sure I have Tylenol, pepto bismol, tums... anything that will stop my stomach from hurting so I can have a decent day. I have been told the H.pylori ruined my stomach lining and It needs to rebuild it self but it will take a long time for this to happen.  So now when I have butter I’m in the WORST PAIN OF MY LIFE, so it seems. Everything else is fine. It’s just butter like... I can seriously eat anything but that..it’s it just me or have these medications hurt me internally? Why do I have so many issues? Now doctors are saying I DONT have food sensitivity, ulcerative colitis, gluten allergy or intolerance... I’m so done with the bull crap ... what is wrong with me now?? Any suggestions?? ..

I was diagnosed with spinal stenosis, severe multi-level degenerative disc disease, arthritis and my SI joint is a mess. Over the years I've had physio, acupuncture and chiropractic treatment. I've been on many medications and had to retire early from work. In January, 2015 I found an excellent massage therapist who got me back on my feet. I was taking 240 mg of morphine SR daily. I tried to come off this a couple of years ago with no success. However, over the last two years I've been able to slowly wean myself off it. It's one of the hardest things I've had to do. I cut down by 15 mg a month. As I decreased the withdrawal symptoms got more severe. Right now I am seven days free of any morphine and still suffering bad withdrawal. It's been the hardest week of my life. Is it worth it? Absolutely! I know this will get better. I still live with back pain but I'm managing through massage, exercises, Pilates and walking. I could barely walk the length of myself and on a good day now I can walk over an hour or more. I have to do stretches and alternate heat and ice but I'm so grateful to get back walking. I used to walk up to three hours years ago. Now I don't expect to get back to that but going for a walk now is my solace. Some days I can't go out at all. I have learned to live life on life's terms and take it one day at a time. Knowing what I know now I would never have gone on the morphine. At the time I felt I didn't have a choice. I just want to encourage others to never give up.","Chronic Pain , Medication , Back Pain"

Ever since I went to splashtown and got water up my nose I've been having so many problems I'm scared I might have something serious.

I can hardly breathe through it and it's basically numb. I also have problems woth my head, it used to be fine but after a couple a months after the incident it feels swollen, i get migraines, and it feels weird and cloudy. I have anxiety but the anxiety fog feels different than what I have. My brain feels numb and I'm unaware of what's going on around me sometimes. It'a really frustrating because i see what i'm doing, i'm just unaware and confused. Then i started having breathing problems. I had an xray donw, and my lungs are fine. I went to the doctor and they said i have VCD (Vocal chord dysfunction) and they said i need to do breathing excersizes. It's been months since then and it has done nothing but get worse. I can barely walk up the stairs wothout feeling out of breathe and about to have an attack. Forgot to mention , i have also been getting these attacks almost like asthma but only when im freaking myself out or during light exersize. Even when i talk its exhausting. My limbs are hard to move and people laugh when i ealk becausw it feels hard to move. My feet vibrate sometimes and it doesnt hurt it just tells me something is wrong. When i move around even for a little bit i get a sharp line of pain in my abdomen. When i stretch i dont feel a stretch it just feels uncomfortable and doesmt feel right. I think i might have nerve problems because thats what it sounds like. I'm ao tired of this. I just want to die im so sick of this. I'm only 15 and im a sophomoore and i feel like i cant enjoy anything anymore. I get no relief, ever its always constant even in my dreams i feel exactly the same. I have asked my parents multiple times to take me to the doctor but everytime i go it never helps. I got diagnoaed with asthma and i think one doctor thought i was just a deluaional teen and just told me to drink more water.

My moving toes started about five years ago. There was no precipitating event, no accident. I just noticed one evening that my toes were moving. In order to get my diagnosis, I saw three neurologists, a podiatrist, my PCP, and my chiropractor. The third neurologist made the call after seeing my foot for about 10 seconds. Then he said, ""I suppose I should look at all your tests and reports--they're all normal, right?"" (Right!). I feel blessed that I am relatively pain free, although I do experience extreme achiness from time to time. I wear toe separators to sleep, as the movements can be maddening and keep me awake. I don't take any medications for it, although I did try gabapentin. My biggest fear is that pain will eventually set in. My neurologist said that chances are that won't happen, but that this condition is so rare that no one really knows the prognosis in any particular case. I was in contact with a foreign doctor via email, and I speculated that painless legs and moving toes is under reported because many people probably wouldn't bother seeing a doctor if the movement was the only symptom. He agreed. I would love if this site could grow enough so that we could entice a specialist to study us for commonalities among our histories and symptoms to see if we could collectively get closer to an effective treatment.",

When I was tested, I did have slight reactions to molds, cigarette smoke, cow dander, and sheep sorrel. I do go into barns with cattle on a friend's farm, but my symptoms don't worsen. Sheep sorrel, I was told, grows in Arizona. I live in Western NY, and have never been to Arizona. As for mold and cigarette smoke, I was told to never take penicillian, and to stay away from smokers (I've never smoked).   Anyone got any ideas as to what is bugging me, and what to do about it? I also get sinus infections when the allergies get bad, and I have had to take breathing treatments with albuterol when the wheezing gets bad.",

I sure hope someone can help. I'm a forty seven year old male in average health. I don't smoke and drink very little. I don't have any conditions that I know about. About eighteen months ago I started to experience these symptoms out of nowhere. There's a sort of heavy feeling in my head, not pain but very unpleasant and constant. I also have low energy and I'm quite tired, drowsy a lot of the time. I was on 20mg citalopram at the time and had been on it for several years without issue. The first doctor I saw put my dose up by 10mg and it got worse so I figured it was the meds. The doctor ordered blood work which all came back normal. As far as he was concerned that was it. End of story. Since then I've seen three other general practitioners, two psychiatrists, three naturopaths and none of them have been able to tell me what's wrong with me. The psychiatrists tried changing my meds but they had the same result. I also had a CT scan which came back normal. I told my psychiatrist that I'd like to try coming off the anti depressant so we worked out a plan to come off it over a few weeks, dropping the dose 5mg every two weeks. I noticed that when I reduced the dose I felt better but the symptoms reasserted themselves within a few days. I was finally off the medication completely for two months but the symptoms didn't go away completely. They got better but they were still there. I was having a hard time coping with the depression so the psychiatrist suggested I go back on them and prescribed sertraline. The symptoms immediately came back as strong as ever. I stopped again after a week. I've noticed that the anti depressant is not the only thing that triggers the symptoms. Non prescription medication such as anti histamine will do it, as will certain herbal supplements like 5HTP and St Johns Wort (for the depression), and also gluten. I don't know where else to turn I just know I can't live like this. I googled a diagnostician and contacted her in the hopes she might be able to diagnose me, I'm just waiting to hear back from her. Am I on the right track or should I see some other type of specialist? What kind of specialist would be appropriate? Thank you I'd appreciate any help and I can give more details if needed.",

But 2-3 days after, I started feeling this ache from the back of my head, top, forehead, and to my eyebrow area. It would usually occur on one side first then they’d alternate. My right ear also momentarily lost hearing twice (like when you’re on a plane) and then I heard this ringing sound that would last for 2 seconds (tinnitus) and this usually happens to me way before. My ENT was normal so ear infection can be ruled out. I’ve been lying in bed since all this except for one day when I went to the mall and felt a little dizzy while walking. I have already gone to the doctor and was only prescribed pain killers. Now the pain has subsided. I now only experience it 4-5 times a day but with the same intensity. I’m worried that it may come back and that there’s a serious underlying issue like aneurysm or a tumor. Also, I recently stopped taking birth control pills so I sometimes like to think these are just withdrawal symptoms to make me at peace. But I desperately need help from those who’ve encountered this or been diagnosed with any brain disease so you can share your experience. Thank you.",

Allergies,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/allergies/76801/one-time-allergic-reaction,One-time allergic reaction,"Something really strange recently happened.  I'm a dog lover. Animal lover really, but dogs ard the only animal i'm not allergic to (or so i thought) so that's the only type of animal i can be around. I have a dog at home (for 9 years now) but since i'm studying away from home i don't see her much. So naturally i go 'awwww!!' Over every dog i see and praise myself lucky whenever i get to cuddle one. The other day i met a lovesick puppy (very loveable bulldog) on the bus making a racket trying to get to me for cuddles. Naturally i go over, sit down by the pup and try to quiet it down, since the owner is busy on the phone and the pup is pulling his leash and staring at me and whining. Licks all over my face and tries to jump into my arms, paws at my face in the process, for several minutes until i have to get off the bus. Totally made my day, who doesn't enjoy some puppy love? But just a few minutes later, while i'm walking home, my face starts itching, and it just gets worse. Pretty soon it's burning and stinging. When i get to the nearest mirror my face looks like i used poison ivy as a facial scrub. It takes an hour and three thorough washes for the stinging to go away and the angry red welts to vanish, but now the rest of my day is a nightmare. That was very obviously an allergic reaction. In all my life i have never had an allergic reaction to any dog, not even a little sneeze, and it's not like i haven't been petting other dogs every few weeks. It was entirely out of the blue. But the strange thing is i got no other symptoms than the burning itchy spots where the dog licked. No watery itchy eyes or clogged nose or full-body itching or breathing problems, and it went away with water and soap. Any other day my allergy attacks last for hours, and i usually have symptoms into the next day. The following day i decided to test... the puppy had nibbled at my gloves, so they should be full of allergens. I rubbed the gloves thoroughly on both my wrists, since wrist skin is some of the most sensitive on the body. I'd definitely welt up again if i was allergic. But nada, no red welts, no mad itching, no burning or stinging. I promised myself i'd pet the next dog i saw and see if i could provoke a reaction (as i'm going home to my own dog in a few days i want to know if i need to bring my heavy duty medication or not.) Today i met another puppy (this one a bulldog too if species matters, but just a few weeks old, wee tiny little adorable thing). He was very eager for cuddles and i consciously let him lick my hands and wrists, then proceeded on my way, careful not to wipe any off. It sounds disgusting, but i had to find out if it would provoce a reaction and it taked a few minutes. I waited half an hour... still nothing. My first encounter with the loveable puppy had provoked a quite noticeable reaction in just one or two minutes. I rubbed my hands on my cheeks and throat just to be sure... still nothing, so i washed off thoroughly. More 'testing' will ensue but... has anyone ever heard of something like this happening, or experienced it themselves? Any idea what could possibly provoke such a random and not exactly mild reaction, or why?","Living & Managing , Hives , Allergy Testing , Treatment , Pets"

I get pain in my teeth, like there’s a buzzing and vibrating going on, and the feeling also exist in my eyes and brow bone, which has made it nearly impossible for me to squint or scrunch my brows without them termoring uncontrollably for several moments. I also have an irregular heartbeat where it sometimes feels as if it’s pounding or beating too slowly. Lastly, there’s also a feeling of fog and disconnect from my body, as if I’m leaving it and am unable to adequately perform tasks like holding a phone, or a fork to eat with.

History of right-sided nerve pain in my temple, under my eye, next to my nose....has been going on on and off for years but never diagnosed or treated. Also have had substantial dental work on upper right side, but endodontist and dentist say pain is not tooth related.  About a month ago had bad sinus headache/pressure in face with postnasal drip and dizziness, but no stuffiness in my nose at all. Was given amox and ENT sent me for a CT scan of my sinuses suspecting sphenoid involvement, but other than a deviated septum, results were pretty normal. Gave me a Medrol Dose Pack for the inflammation and told me to follow up with my primary. Started feeling lousy again and went to ER after having uncontrollable chills/tremors (no fever) and feeling dizzy/off. BP was high. (don't have high BP normally). They did a brain CT scan in the ER and it was normal. Sent me home. Told me to follow up for the high BP.  Had to wait weeks to get back to primary doc so I went to my urgent care when I started feeling burning pains into my carotids....he took blood and sent me for an ultrasound. All came back okay. Back when I saw the ENT for the last time I started tasting something funny in my mouth and she didn't think it was anything. But it just got worse and worse.  Now I taste that taste (it tastes like chemicals) especially when upright for an extended period (it improves markedly when lying down). I also feel my veins ""pulling"" and very dizzy/woozy and nauseated. And my facial pain is back (not severe but enough to remind me it's still there), and the chills are back intermittently too.  Went to a neurologist who is not sure what to make of it and is sending me for a bunch of tests (MRI/MRA, EEG, autonomic nerve tests)....but of course they can't get me in till next week and it will take a little time for results, so we're looking at another week before I know anything (assuming the tests actually show something). My BP has been all over the place and they want to put me on meds for that (I am confident the BP fluctuations are because of whatever is wrong, not the other way around and I'm hesitant to be put on meds).  So if you're still reading....as of now, a month into this ordeal, I still feel totally crappy and not improving at all, if anything I feel worse. I feel like my body is being poisoned, like something is coursing through my veins that doesn't belong there and my body is rejecting it. I am not sure how much I can take and if I can hold out another week like this. I have had to be out of work and been on my couch for days.  After much reading on the internet I suspect a possible CSF leak, though I don't have the headache that goes along with it. I have nausea, dizziness and that taste when upright and it does improve when lying down (although today I was still feeling lousy lying down too). I mentioned this to the primary doctor and she basically laughed at the suggestion. I know I'm reaching, but I'm desperate to be taken seriously and to feel better. I'm hoping the tests will give me some answers but I'm not sure I can wait another week feeling this way. Should I go back to the ER and have them do some tests? It will cost me a small fortune (I have good insurance but ER visits still aren't cheap).... I feel like a hypochondriac and that they'll think I'm crazy.....I have never stepped foot in the ER in my whole life till this past month and I've been there a few times, and I can't say they really helped much with figuring anything out. I've been in tears and very scared and frustrated and just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like this is never going to end and I may drop dead before I get any answers with all the waiting around to see doctors and getting tests.  If you're still reading.....sorry for the novel but I just am at my wit's end. I'm open to all advice. Thanks!",

I have slight weakness in my left arm but not tingling or shaking any where. I did have gastro a week a go so I was thinking it could be Gullian Bare syndrome? But that has even weakness doesn’t it and also tingling which I don’t have? Also I’m having muscle wasting all over my body like in my legs too and idk if that is caused by it? Doctors did urine sample and blood tests and all came back fine also had a basic neurological exam (they tapped me with this metal thing and did a strength test) and I got 5 for strength and didn’t have any hyperflexia but my left arms still feels a little weak like holding my phone. Also have lost 5kgs in like a week even though my diet is healthy and appetite is fine. The doc I spoke to said I can’t lose muscle that quickly so she thinks I’m not losing muscle, is that true? Sometimes I get really overcome with general fatigue especially when my body gets hot and later in the afternoon. That makes me think it could be MS but MS doesn’t cause muscle wasting and atrophy does it?? Correct me if I’m wrong! I’ve got an MRI scheduled for next week. Would that rule out ALS? I calculated the odds and it’s like 1 in 1 million of me having ALS due to my age but you never know?? Also does the onset of muscle atrophy in als happen really quickly like visible muscle wasting in the hands occurring daily? Lastly it’s expensive to go to the doctor in my country and just those simple tests cost $700 and the MRI would be another $600 so like that plays a role too and I’m a student so my parents are paying. They said they don’t want me to have the MRI “cause the other tests came back showing nothing is wrong”. Is that correct? Would MS or ALS show up or there be any hints from a simple neurological exam, chest x Ray and blood test or?? Many thanks in advance docs!",

I have probably experienced more pain in the last 2 years than 99% of people do in their lifetimes and yet this headache was the worst pain I think I've ever felt. I felt extremely dizzy and like I was incapable of thought at all, I just shut my eyes put my head in my hands and waited for about 20 seconds until it passed. Since then they've been occurring more and more frequently, I cant go to the gym whatsoever now as it isn't just a 'sometimes' occurrence, if I lift weight the headache very quickly comes on (not if i lift very low weight). Also in the last 3 days they have begun occurring if I masturbate. I've done some research and apparently this is called a 'sexual headache' however mine differs to them in that it doesn't happen just before/during/after orgasm, it happens when i'm barely aroused to be honest, and I can sorta feel the buildup and explosion.  I also have had a lot of neck stiffness. I saw a doctor (although at the time I was not getting them while masturbating, so she only thought it was during weight lifting) and she said the two are likely related, and to go to a physiotherapist. I have also seen an osteopath that believes it has something to do with the way I hold my neck/head, and has told me how to hold it from now on, as well as given me some stretches to do, I have another appointment with him tomorrow.  Basically my question is this; Is it likely that the headaches are just stemming from my neck stiffness, or is it more likely/possible to be something else? Something about the suddenness and intensity of the headaches, as well as the fact that they occur during masturbation has got me very worried.",

This is my first post, and it’s going to be pretty lengthy as I want to be as thorough as possible, so please stick with me. ***Please please PLEASE be aware: I suffer from a very debilitating case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Please do not say anything alarming to me or just half-hazardously throw ideas out there. I am very much likely to take whatever you say and obsess over it for months on end.*** Back in May of this year I had a laceration on the back of my left hand. I’d never had one before. I went to the emergency room and the doctor glued it shut. My nurse—who I BEGGED not to scare me, as medical concerns of any kind are my WORST nightmare—scared me absolutely senseless. She told be about an infection called cellulitis that, if bad enough, could be fatal. So knowing me, I studied up on the subject. Fast forward a week later. My laceration had healed, no problem, but my hand was swollen to three times its size and itching like ants lived under my skin. My doctor diagnosed me with atopic dermatitis, reacting negatively to the glue or the surgical tape that had closed my wound. They weren’t sure which. They pumped me full of steroids and sent me on my way. Present day... now my palms and my arms seem to be having a very mild form of this same reaction to any bandage adheisives. I’ve been wearing bandaids all over for a week. First off, I had a horrible reaction to some mosquito bites about a week ago. I covered them with Neosporin and slapped bandaids on them. But now because of the itching I had feel like there’s more sores. Mind you, there’s no open bloody sores. Only cracked skin like you would see from itching or dry skin. The bandages I’m sure are further irritating that. I’m scared to take them off because I’m terrified of that cellulitis horror story, and I’m scared to keep them on if I’m making the skin worse. I have had bandaids on my hand and arm as well—those have been removed, except for one on my finger. My finger doesn’t seem to be affected, but my arm and especially the one that was on my hand seems irritated far worse than anything going on with my leg. My leg just looks like dry skin, a little pink (like you would see from having a bandaid on, period). But the hand and arm you can see exactly where the bandaid was placed, as there’s a prominent red outline of it having been placed there. It’s not warm or hot or itchy or painful. Or even raised. No bumps. Just red. My doctors are sick of me, because I’ll be honest... this OCD over my health makes me unbarable to deal with. I need to know what’s going on. I don’t know if it’s safe to take my bandages off my leg. If there’s ANY cracked skin I’m terrified, as I’ve read you can contact cellulitis through just a crack and the most common place for it happening is the lower leg, with obesity being a risk factor—which I’m overweight. I’m just scared and want answers on what to do. I don’t know what will make it better or worse. Bandaids or no? Can anyone give me any information without scaring me??? I don’t know what to do and why I seem to have a sudden bandaid reaction I never had before since the laceration incident. Edit: There is occasional itching on my leg, and I will NOT use Hydrocortisone cream. Vets and the pharmacy said that could be dangerous to house pets, so with my OCD I just can’t bring myself to use it. My doctors have also suggested in the past that I not used antihistamines because they can possibly raise your heart rate, which sends me into panic attacks.","Living & Managing , Treatment"

I had been prescribed a liquid cough syrup (hydrocodone) for bronchitis. Normally narcotic meds make my hands mildly itchy for several days once off of the meds. Initially, my palms and feet started to itch very badly and worse at night. I ended up taking Benadryl which helped for a day and then did not help anymore.  I visited the doctor who put me on Prednisone. While on the meds, I did not have any itching. After completing the treatment, 3 days following the last dose my itching came back but was worse and more intense. My hands and feet no longer itched but my legs and arms started itching badly. I was put on another round of Prednisone which again stopped the itching. 3 days after the last dose the itching came back again and much worse. At this point, most of my body was itching. Strangely however, my hands and feet, scalp, face, and neck did NOT itch.  I went back to the doctor and was put on another round of Prednisone for 12 days instead of 6-7. Blood work was done and my CBC and CMP were normal. Again, Prednisone helped. Although the last few days on smaller doses it did not seem to help as much. I also noticed that I would then have sharp stabbing pains in ny palms but no itching.  I ended up taking Gabapentin because my restless leg and insomnia were severe. This worked and helped the Prednisone as well. I just had another appointment. I still have extreme itching and no Prednisone is being offered. This itching is driving me insane. I have no rashes, no dry skin, no blisters, no hives, no redness. More blood work was done. My CBC showed an elevated White blood cell count (20) but that's presumably from the Prednisone. My CRP and thyroid were fine. There were no allergy/inflammatory responses found. I have not changed shampoo, body wash, lotions, clothes, foods, or detergents. Water, heat, and cold make no difference. I even went so far as to get fragrance free and hypo allergenic. I have cats, but have had them for 8 years. The only consistent medication has been omeprazole daily. I do not take anything else.  I am at a loss as to what this could be. A skin issue should show some outward signs but there is nothing. I was placed on Hydroxyzine and told to supplement with Diphenhydramine and Zyrtec. None of these are working at all! Next steps are referrals to Neuro (to check for auto immune and neuropathic causes). They want to refer to dermatology, but the patch tests and blood work were all negative for any of that.  What could this be? And what can I do to offset the itching? I also tried Zantac/Prevacid as an H2 blocker. Nothing but Prednisone is working and they dont want to prescribe more due to its long term nasty side effects, unless they know the cause. What can I do on my end? Blood work is being repeated Friday. But, I am severely itchy and cant sleep or concentrate.","Living & Managing , Treatment"

The medication has helped me so much with college and my daily life. I feel like my ""real"" self on the medication, the person who i always knew i could be and in another perspective ""normal"".

But when it comes time for my afternoon dose and if i don't take it i feel the ""comedown"" and get slightly anxious and irritable as well as my head hurting sometimes. my doctor told me to take a small dose to help with the come down and it works but its scary to know i have to take more to feel ok throughout the day. Also when i choose to take a day off from taking the medicine i am really really tired, and seem to feel like my ""old"" self but slightly exaggerated (lazy, sad, tired, lower self-esteem). I am really worried bc i am pre med student and know i will have to be on this medication in med school. When i don't take my medicine or don't take my second dose i don't like how it makes me feel. Do i have to take this medication for the rest of my life? Can i not be the person i know i am deep down without the medication? Should i take the medication everyday to avoid the come down or should i be taking days off? will taking this medication for a long time, or at least when im done with med school and get off, hurt my brain or body? Or since ADD/ADHD has to do with a chemical imbalance of specific neurotransmitters, should i be needing to take the medication to be healthy and functioning correctly?  If any of you have experience or feel the same way i have i would really like your advice. Any tips or personal experience would be great, THANK YOU!!","Living With , Symptoms , ADHD in Adults"

I have had the diagnosis since elementary school, but I still have unanswered questions that I don't know how to ask. Fortunately, there's the internet, so here goes: has your ADHD ever impacted your perception of relationships or your readiness for them? Example, when I found out that one of my guy friends was interested in me, I completely re-assessed our friendship. I started to feel like I felt the same way, but the feeling came and went. I don't understand why I can't even tell whether or not I like someone in that way. Also, while all my friends and peers seem to be in relationships or have them in their past, I have never even dipped my toes into romantic waters. I know that everyone reaches a certain level of maturity at their own pace, but that isn't what I'm talking about. What I mean is that when someone asked my out earlier this year, I actually felt panicked. I felt like a cornered animal, and I almost felt threatened, even though there was nothing threatening about the situation to anyone else. I don't know if this is just me, or just being a teenager, or my ADHD, but I'd really like any feedback or personal advice you guys have.

I'm 20, I've drunken Alcoholic drinks in the past but usually always in moderation until the past couple of months. I don't know if my body genuinely has a problem processing alcohol or if I am just a very, very big lightweight. I only weigh around 130 so it would not shock me. Around the end of last summer, I had around 6 lite beers over the span of a few hours and apparently I became so drunk that my roommates thought I had alcohol poisoning and sent me to the ER. Once I got to the ER, the doctors shared quite a laugh, telling me my BAC was infact very low and there were no problems. At first I thought nothing of it, a couple more months passed, until just recently where I've shared around 3 lite beers between a friend and a few minutes later I was once again passed out near the toilet. I didn't go to the hospital but I knew that time that something was off. I know it's kinda hard to give a professional medical opinion over just a story, but is there a possibility that my body has an allergy or something to alcohol?

First was dx'ed w/ sinus infection, even tho no congestion. Went to Dr. again, referred for MRI w/ contrast, given 7-days of Fioricet. Didn't last 7 days - had to call to get ok to take 2 at a time just to make headache bearable.  MRI said to come back normal. Results had note mentioning areas of elevated activity - lesions in white matter - that were noted as ""within normal limits for age"". I'm 45. Have read that age related lesions are found mostly over age 60, and only 30% at that. Referred to neurologist, who also said MRI normal, dx'ed as ""migraine"", rx for 6 days steroid pills. He wanted to give Depakote for prevention, but when I said I wasn't comfortable taking Depakote, he seemed annoyed & offered no alternative. GP wouldn't refill 7-day Fioricet rx, (which barely worked anyway), & when I asked for a migraine relief rx, he said, ""but it's not a migraine"". Waited over 2 weeks for neuro appointment with no headache pain relief. Now, I'm frustrated. No pain relief for weeks from GP, b/c ""not a migraine"", then neuro says migraine.  No headache history. I had one full-blown seizure, last year, indicated on my paperwork, & neurologist didn't ask about or acknowledge it. Noises make my headaches much worse. I've had ocular migraines 2 or 3 times/yr for years, no pain, just blindness in peripheral of one eye with ziggy black lines in vision. Lasts 1 hour or less.  I also mentioned a ""brain seizure"" type feeling that I've had regularly, to which my neurologist smirked and shrugged off, saying he has no idea what that is. I know brains don't feel anything, but that's the only way I can describe that feeling. Sometimes that feeling is relieved a little by vigorously shaking my head (which makes my headache and dizziness worse for a min.), but lessens that feeling of something rapidly vibrating or an electrical storm or whatever happens with this ""brain seizure"" feeling. (A) Is my MRI considered normal at 45 y.o., w/the notes about the white matter lesions and over-activity in that area being normal for my age? (B) Is Depakote a normally-used 1st response for migraine prevention? I've already been on zoloft for yrs. (C) Does this sound like a migraine? (D) What do I do now, since my GP left me suffering for weeks saying not a migraine, referring me to neuro who says it is a migraine?  I don't work & am under no stress. We noticed the neuro spent a little more time listening to the left side of my neck with the stethoscope & took extra time examining my left eye from the left side of the eyeball w/ his light.

My family describes the scream as if I'm terribly scared. Is this normal? I've been told that it is common for someone to scream at the beginning of a seizure but they have never heard of one at the end.

Do not every try,"I was curious about how Adderall was suppose to make you feel when you take it for fun so some friends and I decided to try it on Friday night. We all took about 50mg. Now I feel as if their is a ring around around my head, like im wearing a hat, I am not in any pain, what is wrong with me? My head is also slightly tingly. Other than that I Feel fine and after a quick search online I have no other symptoms just this one I can't explain... Note: I do not wear hats, nor any kind of helmet which would suggest that this would happen as a result of actually having a ring of pressure around my scalp.

Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly: • school - i seek out conversation for help, but then i can’t listen to anything that the other person is saying. ex 1: my friend sawyer has tried to help me with aleks a lot in the past, and even though i would personally ask him how to do something, i would stare right through him while he would explain. then i’d be too embarrassed to tell him i wasn’t listening, so i’d have to pretend i understood what he meant.  • social - i’ll be talking to a friend and they’ll need to tell me either 1) an important piece of information or 2) a story. ex 1: my friend kelsey was telling me about what she was going to do for her summer and even though i was trying so hard to listen and make direct eye contact, i only picked up that she was going back to texas. ex 2: i was helping my best friend, kameron, clean her room out because it was a huge mess. i would ask her where to put certain stuff that she wanted to keep, and she’d tell me, i’d respond “okay cool”, and then almost immediately forget. it felt like i was hearing her but i wasn’t listening if that makes sense.  makes me feel like a hypocrite because i hate when people don’t listen to me when i tell them something important + sets me back academically because i can never progress when given assistance  Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork or workplace duties:  • school - i’ll be told to do homework or to take notes but then i never do even if i really need to for my own success. ex 1: within the first couple months of bio, we were learning about the basics of life like biochemistry. i wasn’t exactly engaged in the class, so people like me were expected to go home and take notes off of the online content provided. i would never do that for the biochem unit, or frankly any of the other following units, and i didn’t do great in the class overall. i got a 68 on the biochem test that dragged my grade to a point of no return. ex 2: my math teacher had to get onto me several times about being behind on aleks even after she would tell me to go home and do a bit of extra work to be on track.  • home - i’ll be told to get something or to do a chore countless times but i won’t do it until the person asking gets irritated with me not doing what they ask. ex 1: my mom told me to get our camera ready for our trip to kenya for several days before i took two minutes to plug in the battery and put the camera body downstairs. the thing is, it wasn’t intentional. i wasn’t trying to annoy my mom or anything; i just completely forgot to do it over and over again until she got mad and a sense of “oh *** yeah i was supposed to do that” came over me.  i feel lazy and annoying because i bother others and set myself back from never doing what’s expected and asked of me  Often has difficulty organising tasks and activities: • school - when i’m given an assignment that i estimate will take me longer than 30 or 45 minutes, i don’t know how to even start them. usually i’ll just try to start with the easiest stuff or in the middle of it (if possible) just so i feel like i’m getting stuff done. in addition, i’ll do idle stuff like change fonts and type sizes or flip through my notebook. ex 1: when writing dbqs for ap world, i would look at the prompt, glance over the documents, and then immediately start writing. i wouldn’t plan anything; i would just do it as i went so i wouldn’t have to think about the organization that much. my teacher got onto me a LOT about it. i conferenced with her about one of my essays once and she criticized my lack of planning saying that i should know how to do it because we’ve practiced it so much, and just started crying. ex 2: i had to do an infographic for bio about cells in the beginning of tenth grade. it was supposed easy and straightforward, but my teacher complicated it a lot so i didn’t really know what i was doing and i realized it was going to take me awhile to finish. at this point, i put it off for a long time, but when i got around to it i tried to start on the easier parts that were close to the end. this only just made it harder in the long run, because i had to reorganize the page to fit everything due to the lack of foresight that i had with the layout.  i’ve seen that poor time management is also a part of this symptom so in the case that it is, ex 3: i’ve always loved science but in seventh grade, it was a mess. i had a really intense teacher that wouldn’t hold back consequences for anyone, and i sometimes walked into his class shaking because i hadn’t finished work that he had assigned. towards the end of the second semester, our year long science project was due and i hadn’t even started. i had an idea and i had turned in portions of the project before, but i hadn’t done any part of the actual experiment i was conducting or any of the presentation board. i had to do the whole thing in one night and although i wasn’t stressed (i had hit a breaking point with stress where i didn’t even feel stress anymore because his class was too much for me) i was freaking out the whole time.  • home - more on the time management of my life, ex 4: usually i’ll wake up with around 20 or 30 minutes to get ready for school. however i’ll go really slowly to get up and get ready for the day. i pretty much always end up running out of the house to my bus with only about a minute to spare.  • social - i rarely show up to friend events on time and it annoys nearly everyone. ex 5: i was supposed to go to a birthday party of a friend who lives in my compound, but i somehow arrived an hour late because i didn’t think about the timing.  this makes me feel incredibly frustrated with myself because my lack of time management and organizational patterns for work and my own life wastes a lot of my time. in addition, it disrespects the people that i try to spend time with and i don’t ever want that to happen.  Often avoids, dislikes or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort: • school - like i said earlier, i won’t do things until the last minute unless they won’t take much of my time or effort. when i do mentally exert myself, such as by writing this entire summary, i pretty much feel brain dead. ex 1: for ap world, i had to do those notes over eid break. i had avoided doing them for almost two weeks already because i knew it would be so much work, but after i finished them i was absolutely exhausted. i wasn’t proud of my work even though i tried to work really hard, and my brain just hurt from all the effort that i put into them. ex 2: for math this year, we were given several days that we could take the same test and i would choose the latter date more often than not because i just didn’t want to take the test. even if i was prepared, which in most cases i was, i just desperately didn’t want to put in the work of taking a test when i could just tell my teacher i “need more time to prepare”.  this makes me feel like i’m way too lazy considering that i’m going into the hardest year of high school next year. it makes me kind of anxious because i feel like i’m going to drown in my harder classes next year just from putting things off.  Is easily distracted by extraneous stimuli: • every context - if there’s something that seems more interesting than what i’m doing, i’ll choose to focus on that rather than suffer through something comparatively boring. ex 1: we have school issued laptops that have very few game websites blocked, so if i’m in a class that’s not holding my attention i’ll just play games instead. ex 2: in choir we have music stands and lots of breaks between the times that we sing, so on most days i’m on my phone in that class when i shouldn’t be just checking my email or instagram. ex 3: when i’m at home supposed to be doing homework, i’ll usually watch netflix instead because i’m able to. ex 4: if im having a boring conversation with a teacher or acquaintance, i’ll try to look at their face or behind them to find something that’s a little more interesting.  this makes me feel super rude and disrespectful to the people that are trying to hold my attention because i don’t pay attention to them.  Is often forgetful in daily activities: • school/ social - i’ll often forget what i’m talking about halfway through a sentence if i’m slightly interrupted. ex 1 (school): during socratic seminars where you’re expected to make articulate arguments out loud, i forget what i’m saying halfway through a point and i have to scramble to try to finish what i’m saying and have it connect to whatever i was saying last. in ninth grade we were doing a seminar about romeo and juliet and i was talking about who knows what up until i lost my train of thought and couldn’t get it back. ex 2 (social): more times than not, i’ll be talking with a friend and forget what i’m saying in the middle of the sentence and not be able to return to what i was saying without help.  it makes me feel so slow and stupid. i don’t know anyone else that forgets everything midway through a conversation, so i always get kind of frustrated with how dumb i look.  hyperactive/impulsive Often talks excessively: • social - if im really interested in a topic, i won’t stop talking about it. ex 1: i get really excited by psycho-analyzing people with my friends and i’ll talk over them for long periods of time saying what i think and why i think that.  i feel rude because i don’t let other people talk when we’re in a two way conversation.  Often blurts out answers before a question has been completed: • social - a lot of the time i’ll try to guess what people are saying so they finish they’re question quicker. i mostly do this with people around my age that are more forgiving, but it sometimes happens with teachers and i always feel really bad afterwards because i feel like i disrespected them. ex 1: i was at a park with two acquaintances and my best friend, but one of the acquaintances said he wanted to talk to me in private so we sat on a bench while the others walked away. he basically went on to tell me how he fell in love with my personality like never before and how he wanted a relationship with me. i wasn’t really surprised so it wasn’t like i was anxious about it or anything but i was still trying to finish all of his sentences and answer his questions about a relationship before he finished asking. i wasn’t helping his nerves at all, and i knew that, but i still did it for the entire conversation.  this just makes me feel rude because i can never just let people talk. i always have to come in at random to try to get the conversation to go quicker.  Often interrupts or intrudes on others: • social - i’ll hear people talking about something that i know about and i’ll butt right in uninvited. in addition, i’ll be talking with a friend and they’ll say something that reminds me of another thing that’s usually unrelated to the conversation so i always say “sorry to interrupt you but [the thing the conversation reminded me of]”. ex 1: maya and hassan we’re talking about how this girl that they both used to hate while i was sitting nearby, and instead of mind my own business like i tried to do, i asked them if they still hated her or not.  this makes me feel really bad and like i don’t have proper social skills. i just want to fit in but i feel like i never can.  other notes: • pretty sure it’s not a depression thing because it’s always been like this. i lack motivation to work now because of the formative/ summative system, but i still procrastinate just as much. the only difference over time is that in texas i was fueled by the anxiety that something bad was going to happen to me if i didn’t finish all of my work, but in qatar i have nothing to worry about because tests and projects are the only things that are due.  if it were depression, i wouldn’t have had any motivation while i was living in texas because i was so constantly depressed that i always felt like killing myself. also im medicated for depression and i have been for a while, so i don’t know if that has any weight.  • i had about three concussions when i was a kid and i don’t know if that means anything.  • i love routine. i like to have everything generally in order and i like to have things stay the same (as an example of how bad it can be: i didn’t leave my abusive boyfriend because i needed the consistency of him being in my life). however, it’s really hard for me to start making something routine a lot of the time. for example, it’s really hard for me to remember to shower every other day even though i know i need to. it’s also really hard for me to remember to wash my face twice a day, so i just generally do it once or less.  • i’ll tell people the same story more than once ALL THE TIME because i forget that i told them. • when a teacher gives instructions and someone next to me asks what to do after the teacher finishes, i can never tell them because i’ve already forgotten and i was going to just go with the flow.","ADHD in Children , Symptoms , Diagnosis"

Brain & Nervous System Disorders,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/brain-nervous-system-disorder/27192/weird-health-episode-this-morning,Weird health episode this morning,"Hello all, I had a bit of health scare today and I was wondering if anyone here can help me figure what happened. I'm a 55-year-old man who's in pretty good health. And last night I drank some wine, too much really, about a bottle and a half. So when I woke up this morning I was not surprised to find my thinking a little fuzzy. But I felt pretty normal. I went into the kitchen, got a cup of coffee and sat down at my computer where I found myself unable to remember the last three letters of my seven-letter password. I've entered this password into my computer probably 10 times a day for at least five years. It's also a common word, not something made up. And yet I couldn't remember the last three letters. So I said to myself - aloud - something like ""What the hell is wrong with me?"" But actually I didn't really say that because I found I couldn't speak. I could make noise but I couldn't make my mouth form words. After a few minutes, I was able to force myself to say the names of some people I know - Mom, Joe, Tom, then a few simple sentences. But I sounded (and I don't mean to be insensitive here) like someone who'd had a serious stroke. And I was beginning to worry that's what had happened to me. Meanwhile, I could walk and move just fine, I'd remembered my password, and I could read normally. But I still couldn't talk. Also, my thinking was normal and, for some reason, I was pretty sure what was happening to me would be temporary. And it was. After about 20 or 25 minutes, in the space of just a second, my speech returned and I was back to normal. It was like someone flipped a switch. Maybe I should also mention that during the whole episode I had a very runny nose. So my question is, has anyone else ever experienced something like this? My theory is that part of my brain hadn't woken up yet but that's a complete guess. Anyway, I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts. And no, I haven't seen a doctor yet but I'm planning to next week. Thanks in advance, William in Brooklyn",

I am currently driving through Mexico with my brother. We are in a 1985 Ford E-250 camper. While on the highway, there was a clog in the muffler and some fumes entered the vehicle. We kept driving (with the windows down) for several hours until we got the exhaust system serviced.  Yesterday (24 hours after exposure) I was still feeling some symptoms. A ""tension"" like headache and was not clear headed. No nausea. No vomiting. No back pain or muscle aches. It seems my vision is normal. Still, just fuzziness and I wasn't as sharp as usual. So just to be on the safe side, we went to a private hospital in Monterrey, Mexico. They did an X-ray of my lungs and took a blood test. The X-ray came out fine. They said the blood test came out fine, but upon talking to them further, I understood they were not equipped to do a proper blood test to test for hemoglobin in the blood. They said I don't need to worry since the other information they got from the blood test is fine. They hooked me up to oxygen for an hour and then released me.  Today (60 hours after exposure) I'm still feeling the symptoms. Maybe a little bit better but not much. My brother doesn't feel anything.  Is the recovery something that just takes a while to recover from or should I go get another test? Would more oxygen be helpful? For how long? Maybe I can just ask a doctor here in Mexico to give me some oxygen.  The blood tests came out as follows: PH 7.40, PO2 33.0 mmHg, PCO2 47.0 mm Hg, CO2 T 30.5 mmol/L, SAT O2 64.0%, HCO3 29.1 Mola/L, EX DE BASE 4.3 mil/L Are these tests enough to rule out large exposure to CO?",
