Sexual Health & STDs,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/2545/clhamydia-help,Clhamydia Help!!,"Hello. I'm a 21 year old male, I was recently tested positive for clhamydia. Now I've never gotten an STD before. Before I knew this, here's how it started. For about a few weeks, I started to develop this small burning sensation when I peed. Another thing I noticed was the tip of my penis, whenever touched like by my clothes (inside my pants) or even a slight touch of my finger it would hurt. So I figured it would go away but it didn't. So on December 22 I went to my local urgent care and they did the urine test. Come Christmas Eve they told me I was positive for clhamydia. I was prescribed 2 pills 500 Mg of azithromycin one dosage to take at once. They said it would take about a week for symptoms to go away. It's odd though because I've been drinking a lot of water and it soothes the burning, but once in awhile it will still burn. Also the touching of the tip still happens. Now it's been a week and I still have both of these symptoms. I called the nurse from the urgent care and just told me to call to come in again during the week. Now my question is, when will these symptoms go away? I still have the burning and weird touching feeling still. Is possible I have something else and not clhamydia? What should I do? Just can't really call or go in due to the holidays. I've never had this before and just want the symptoms to go away. Thank you!","Chlamydia , Men's Issues"

It's all about me. My wife will occasionally perform Fellatio. The problem is -- I do not benefit from it. In fact, I cannot keep an erection when she wants to do this for me. Weird, right? I can't ejaculate when she is performing Fellatio. When she is performing, all I do is stare at her. My wife believes that I might have problems with relaxing which causes me not to ejaculate that way, I've tried several times to shut my eyes, you know like they do in porn, but still I can't find any enjoyment of this. I have told her stories being with other girls...Prior to being married. I had the same problem. It’s like some kind of sexual block. Do you believe that would cause this kind of issue?

No real history of medication, except for I did take a 6 month dose of Accutane to treat severe acne. This was about 1-2 years ago. So the problem started within this past year. The issue is that I have been experiencing painful and bloody bowel movements for a while now and it has gradually gotten worse over the past year. My mother is a nurse, so we have a habit of just ""toughing it out"", but I am beginning to get a little worried, considering how the problem has progressed and how long it has persisted. When I have a BM I experience a sharp pain in the rectal area, and bright red blood. The bleeding has been getting progressively worse over the past year to the point where tonight, after passing stool, a few drops of blood dripped into the toilet, and there was a substantial amount of blood on the toilet paper. Also, recently i have been able to feel a small bump near the anus. It is fairly small and hard. At first I thought hemorrhoids, but the symptoms only occur when having a BM. No pain, itching, or anything at any other time. This leads me to believe that it may be something more serious! I would be super embarrassed to go to the doctor and it just be hemorrhoids, but I am scared it could be something else. I am happy to answer any questions that you may have that would help clear things up. I just need an opinion of if I should be worried and if I should go to the doctor to get it looked at!

I know to go to a urologist for peace of mind, but that s next week, so I wish to come here firstly. The underside of the glans (the part that faces away from me, where the frenulum attaches to the head) has had some painless bruising for most of 2017. It s reddish/purplish and is more visible when I m erect. There seems to be a single red line that kind of runs from the slit to the frenulum. As I said though, completely painless. The red line is surrounded by purplish-cloudy discolouration. Last time I had sex was August 2016. I never had intercourse unprotected, although I did receive oral sex without a condom. Supposedly my partner did not have a STI.  The problem first arose in late February 2017. It seems to have worsened slightly over time, but never hurt me so it wasn t alarming. But now that it isn t going away, and future sex is on the horizon, I m worried it will look alarming to my partner. Around this time (Feb 2017,) I began to masturbate fairly frequently (4-6 times daily.) So this correlates with my bruising becoming apparent. I noticed the bruising worsening by May, so I decided to step down to my usual 1-2 times a day. No improvement, seems to be worsening a bit.

I am a twenty year old female with long history of various symptoms. Let's paraphrase & start at the beginning: I have always had a weak immune system, constantly getting infections or bronchitis as a child. Around age 18, my health began to weaken substantially. At this point my biggest symptoms were exhaustion, ruptured ovarian cysts ( pain so bad putting me at the ER) and the beginning of my GI problems (will elaborate later). In the summer of 2015 at age 19, after an episode of syncope, shortness of breath and constant dizziness, I went to a PC and they forwarded me to cardiology. After extensive testing, they found I had a sporadic tachycardia (reaching 189 bpm at rest) and started me on beta blockers (metoprolol) which eliminated those symptoms. In the beginning of 2016, I visited the PC again after finding a mass in my collarbone area, joint pain and spiking of digestive problems: no appetite (only eating one meal a day), nausea, abdominal pain, constant diarrhea, and blood in stool. After testing they found I had high protein & calcium in my blood and a calcified lung nodule. I was referred to a rhemotologist at the possibility of having lupus or another autoimmune problem, she tested and found high Immunoglobins E and referred me to GI as she said she could do nothing else. I was so thankful for the GI doctor I got, as he apologized for having been passed around so much. Began testing, first colonoscopy/endoscopy, finding irritation and a precancerous polyp but no celiac or crohns. Tested gallbladder, was normal. Did elimination diet to test for food allergies, no significant findings. Have recently had a SIBO breath test and abdominal CT and waiting on results. I am currently taking pantoprazole, IB &FD gard, Carafate, ranitidine, probiotics as well as ondansetron and diclocymine as needed. My condition flares and ceases consistently, and currently the biggest problems are the digestive mentioned above, extreme fatigue (can sleep 11 straight hours, wake up, and three hours later I am exhausted) , cold intolerance, and cough.

It all started a month ago when i started to feel pain under my breasts, which I sometimes got from excess acid, but it usually went away after a short while. This time it persisted and I also got back pains(middle/upper back) and abdominal pain(both upper and lower abdomen and also on the sides), as well as nausea. I went to my GP and after palpation she diagnosed me with gastritis and put me on esomaprazone and other acid inhibitors. After two weeks I stopped the treatment and got really bad acid reflux that caused burning in my throat and other GERD symptoms(globus,trouble swallowing etc.) so I went again. She put me on the same drug diet for a while but I got really worked up about everything so she also reffered me to get an endocopy. The back pain didn't go away so I also did an X-ray which showed a flat back?(not sure what the term is in english exactly), and my doc insisted it wasn't related to my GI problems, although I find it really weird it started at the same time. The endoscopy showed gastritis and bile reflux and the doc suggested I get an ultrasound (suspected bile problems) but didn't think it was anything serious going on. Bloodwork was normal, as well as urine tests. The back pain also went away for like a week. A week ago I went skiing and more weird and worrying symptoms started to appear, mainly pain in left side and near my belly-button(around it somehow) which a read can show pancreatic problems. Also my back pain came back after being gone for a while( 1 week?). Left side pain got better but navel pain persisted and now i get random pains sometimes in my abdomen. I've developed crippling health-anxiety and after scares such as pulmonary cancer (read about asociated abdominal pain, and also muscle weakness which I experienced, but the X-ray came out clean) and esophageal cancer, I now fear pancreatic cancer. I didn't do an ultrasound yet (scheduled for one in 3 days) and although I now I'm young but I show a lot of symptoms and it got me so worked up I find myself bursting into tears. My stool has also been lighter than usual (light-brown to yellow-ish) but according to the internet it's normal? not sure where the line is drawn. I've also been more constipated than usual, but at first I didn't pay attention to it since it was listed as a common side effect of one of the drugs I've been taking. I've since got of said drug and although i have a daily stool ( usually 2 times a day) i feel like something isn't right since I used to go more often since all of this started. I have no history of cancer in the family, but i used to be a heavy smoker and drinker before all of this. I eat well and didn't lose weight as of yet.

It started off with constant burning the burning would be worse after a burp. I tried over counter medicine which didnt work for me at all. My friend with who i went gym with said he has acid reflux and gave me few PPI tablets to try omeprazole which gave me such a great relief. He said he usually takes a course and hasnt got problems for months with me it was different, its been over a year now and if i dont take a tablet i struggle to cope. It usualy takes 2-3 up to a week for the burning to come back after i stop taking the tablet. I also realised that even if i do take a tablet and drink on the weekend i will still wake up with the burning sensation above my stomach as i said its worse when i burp after i burp its like some acid is going out above my stomach. I recently started feeling nauseas i dont know but i also have health anxiety so anything happening to me i think straight away that its cancer. But i read it could be the nausea from taking of the omeprazole. It doesnt happen much sometimes at all sometimes during the day usually around 3-6 oclock i feel this vomiting feeling for some reason. I have also realised that it happend to me twice after heavy drinking i would vomit coffee grounds or some blood but i dont vomit at all if i dont drink. I have read that all that stuff is GERD symptoms. I have been to a doctor after 3 months of taking omeprazole and he had told me that i am too young for cancer ( i am 25) and also to carry on taking the tablets if they do help and prescribed another 3 months course. I am planning to do gastroscopy to see what is happening but with my health anxiety i dont think il be able too im to scared it will turn out something worse than GERD. I started reading on the internet all this stuff about omeprazole masking the actual stomach cancer and i am so scared. However I heard of people having exactly the same symptoms as me. My questions is if i do have gerd or i have inflammed esophagus why the long treatment of omeprazole isnt helping? Usually i hear people will take a 2 month course and that would be it. Same with stomach ulcers i read that the symptoms let off after taking the tablets. With me is the way that the tablets do help and sometimes i forget to take the tablet but if i dont take the tablets for couple of days the symptoms come back with the same force like nothing changed. My question is if its stomach ulcer, gerd etc. why do symptoms persist? I am very scared that i have cancer. Although i feel fine as long as i take the tablets.

Outbreaks have always been very minor, I have never had a full blown eruption followed by scabs and such. They have always been around the same spot on the meaty portion of my lower lip, and i have never had more than 1 or 2 per year.  About 2 or 3 months ago, I had a small outbreak along the edge of my lip, two small blisters, about 1/4"" apart. They healed quickly, but since then, I have had recurring redness and slight inflammation at one of those blister spots. It looks similar to a new blister forming, but it is not really the same. It's not like an actual blister, just more like a single small puffy spot. If I stretch my lip tight, it disappears, unlike a cold sore blister. I cant feel it with my tongue, which is usually the tell tale sign for me. There is no warning, heat, tingle, burn, pain, or any other warning or symptom. I dont feel under the weather at all like I normally do when a cold sore is coming. It doesnt grow, and nothing comes of it. It usually goes down after a few days, and as the skin grows out, there is never any sign as if there may have been a lesion under the skin.  I was extremely stressed out out when this was happening because we have a newborn at home, and I have been so paranoid to infect my wife, who could in turn infect our daughter. I thought I was having some sort or relapse or recurring sore. But I am starting to think that maybe this is just a side effect of the trauma to the area from the one outbreak a couple of months ago. The redness can even come and go throughout the day, as can the degree of puffiness. Has anyone else experienced this? I saw a doctor a couple of weeks ago and had him run every test they have from STD's to cancer to see if there was a reason for recurring outbreaks, and other than coming back positive for HSV-1(obviously) and my cholesterol being a little high, everything else is completely fine.

Shortly afterward, I developed a sore throat, a white coating on my tongue, halitosis, and these spots at the back of my throat. It's hard to see in the pictures, but there are also white streaks there too. Those folds of tissue on both side are also pink and inflamed, as can be seen pretty clearly in the first picture. I've also experienced lethargy, weakness throughout my body, and abdominal pain.   In the last two months have had two sets of STD panel tests -- urine for Chlamydia/Gonorrhea, blood for HIV and Syphilis -- which all came back negative. However, my clinic and doctor both said they do not do throat swabs, which from what I understand are needed for oral infections, as they can not necessarily be detected through urine tests.  The nurse would not provide the antibiotics just in case, and dismissed the spots as post nasal drip. From everything I can find on post nasal drip, it does not seem to cause such spots, which I know for a fact were not there before. They haven't really changed over that 3 month period. My partner claims she's clean, but she would've only had the same tests as I did. She also complained of a ""cold"" and sore throat over the past few months. It seems too much of a coincidence for these not to be somehow related to and caused by the unprotected encounter. Unfortunately, before looking into it, I was not aware that STDs beyond herpes could be transmitted orally. Now I discover that chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV strains, and syphilis for that matter all can. Could this be attributable to one of those? I'm thinking HPV, chlamydia, or gonorrhea, but have had trouble finding pictures of similar oral symptoms.  Any input on what they could be is appreciated.

I felt no tingling before I felt pain on my lip, at which time I saw two pin-head size ""bug bites"" that later grew into blisters. Then a few hours later I realized what it was and bought some Abreva, which may be helping, no idea really. Anyway, I only started to feel tingling the day after the blisters started. My understanding was that tingling only happened before the blisters appeared.  So I'm wondering if tingling can happen at any time, or if the blistering is still going to continue, despite my use of Abreva and now a 1-day heavy dose of Valtrex. I have only been symptomatic for about 48 hours or so now, so basically the tingling started 24 hours I first saw blisters. I'm wondering if this is more of a ""I just contracted oral herpes and this is what happens the first time"" or ""this is just how it is sometimes and I probably had it for years"". The doctor said the latter is more likely as I have been RIDICULOUSLY stressed lately and was lacking proper sleep.

My wife and I have been together since December 31, 1995. Last week she went in for her yearly check up with her gynecologist. Everything came back good except for one thing. She had a positive HPV test result. We both have been monogamous since we have met each other. How could this show up 21 years later? I was only with 3 other girls before I met my wife. The one before I met my wife is the one who concerns me the most. She was very promiscuous and her ex was in and out of prison. I was 20 then and very ashamed of my past. I didn't want to be with that type of woman, so I ended the relationship and a few months later I met my wife. Could I have gotten HPV from one of the ex-girlfriends (mainly the one before I met my wife), passed it to my wife and it is just showing up? I have read a lot about it going dormant and then becoming active again later in life. How true is that? My wife has been under a ton of stress for about a year. I mean a ton. Could stress cause it to ""flare up"" after so long? I feel horrible that something I did 21 years ago before I met her is affecting her now. Her doctor says it will be fine and is nothing to worry about, but I do. She is such an amazing and loving woman and does not deserve this. Please help me understand this.

Biopsies were performed and returned negative. The tests and screenings have all come back inconclusive or with negative results. Doctors have suggested my mother adopt a gluten free diet, which she has since 2014. Overall my mother's diet has consisted of gluten free waffles for breakfast, peaches, or blueberries on top, small coffee black, chicken broth, boiled chicken, and occasionally a rice noodle dish from the local Asian food place.

Basically, anything with Senna will cause me pain, which seems to be the ingredient in most natural/herbal laxatives.

Some of the things that do NOT work for me include: - Hot water in the morning (with/without lemon) - Teas/coffees or any hot drinks(esp. green tea with peppermint – still nope!) - Dried fruit (sometimes it works, but causes cramps and pain!) - Regular exercise - Fibre powders (e.g. Fybogel) - Green/alkaline veg I was wondering if you guys had any recommendations for me based on this?

However, it may not work for everyone.  Therefore, they might opt for Cialis or Levitra. This gives millions of men of all ages even more of a chance to experience a more satisfied-and confident-sex life.  To be fair, these are not the only solutions available. There are also plenty of herbal supplements dedicated to helping a man achieve an erection and gain energy and stamina.  However, some of them (although maybe are safe) are not approved by the FDA. There also is another issue in that some fraudulent drug companies sell what they claim is “herbal Viagra” of which there is no such thing.  Again, this is not to discount the validity of certain herbal solutions. However, part of the huge Viagra scam circulating the Internet involves claiming that herbal solutions are an exact replica of Sildenafil Citrate. Some of the herbal scams have caused men to gravitate to solutions they know they can count on. For them, it may not necessarily be Viagra though. Instead, it might be another such as two other top drugs, such as Cialis and Levitra.",Men's Issues

When I inserted my finger to test the discharge was questionable. After my period I had itching again. Waited 3 days. Inserted finger in my vagina & was VERY clumpy very cottage cheese like. By now it was very itchy & uncomfortably. Took one day monistat and put cream on vagina area and wiped and cleaned area as medicine and discharge kept coming out... Very uncomfortable and painful. I never noticed any sores. Very irritated by next day to point could not bear. Called & got appt for next day. Day of apt used a wipe at dr office before giving urine sample. Burned terribly. Vagina very swollen & raw at this point. When dr examined me she said I had sores & wanted to test for herpes as precaution because she did not know for sure. Sores not concentrated in one area like herpes & sent me on way with rx for flucanazola & acyclovir. That was Thursday. Today is Saturday morning. I am so grossly swollen & in pain with no relief. Nothing is working to relieve this & now am so scared to find out if I have herpes. I really believe this was for sure a really bad yeast infection although never had this so bad. The two times I have had sex were with condoms. I did have oral sex with someone new twice within the 7-20 time period they say herpes can occurr. This Why I am so scared. I know have to wait for blood result but in mean time I'm very scared & am in so much pain I want to go to er.

Sexual Health & STDs,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/1918/chlamydia,Chlamydia?,"Hello. About a week ago, I had unprotected sex with a girl. Everything was fine at first, however, a few days later (approximately 3 days after), I noticed a discomfort/mild pain developed in my right testicle. I really notice it when sitting in certain positions or sometimes when I am moving around. The pain is localized mostly at the top of the right testicle, slightly posterior and slightly to the right. Upon self-examination, I noticed that no swelling was present in my testicle or epididymis, but I did find it to be tender and painful in what felt like the tube connecting to the right testicle at the top. The pain is more prevalent on some days as compared to others, so sometimes it feels normal and other times it feels more tender and slightly more painful. A week ago, when I first started noticing this, I went to see a doctor and he examined my scrotum/testicles and did not feel anything wrong as well. He took a urine sample, which I have not yet been contacted about in terms of results, and it has been a week already. The clinic I went to says if they do not call you, then that means nothing is wrong with the urine sample. This slight pain/discomfort has been present for about a week now. It does not hurt to ejaculate or pee, and my semen looks quite normal in terms of colour. I have had chlamydia before where my testicle swelled up and I had epididymitis (which I have been treated for already) but this does not seem to be the case here nor the same kind of pain/discomfort. What could this be? I need to figure it out soon so that I could get the proper treatment (if necessary) so if anyone could possibly help me in any way, that would be greatly appreciated.

Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/358/frustrating,Frustrating,"Hello! I am 24 years old and was told I have GERD by a doctor a little over a month ago after experiencing a week + of constant and extreme burning sensations in my stomach/chest, an awful taste in my mouth and morning breath, an increase in burping, a huge increase in saliva production (which I used to associate with the feeling of vomiting) and not being able to stand up straight without feeling worse. My doctor immediately came to the conclusion that I had GERD and prescribed a PPI - 20mg of omeprazole to take once daily, in the morning 30 mins before eating. I have been taking the pills religiously and have made a complete lifestyle change; cut out all food/liquids that I read can irritate my stomach, eating smaller meals more frequently and slowly, been careful to not lay down until at least 2 hours after eating, completely stopped drinking alcohol and all caffeine (except the occasional herbal green tea that is caffeinated). In other words, I feel I have made all the right steps and should be feeling much better... And I was until about 1 week ago... I started to get a tickle in my throat and a runny nose, which at first I just attributed to a regular old common cold. However this cold is different than any other I've experienced; a constant cough and mucus, wheezing in my chest before/during/and after coughing, constant extremely runny nose, the burning pain I experienced before my lifestyle changes & meds in my stomach when coughing, the weird taste in my mouth after coughing/sniffling mucus, occasional but extreme dizziness, and occasional but extreme shortness of breath while talking even at a very low decibel.  Sorry I know this is such a long post but I am desperate to see if anyone else has experienced anything like this. I originally thought it was an unrelated sickness but now I feel that my GERD and this freak cold may be linked somehow. I am very frustrated because I have completely committed to trying to fix the issue to no avail. I am a waitress and I am completely embarrassed having these issues while taking care of people & their food and cannot afford to take anymore time off work. I plan on heading back to the doctor as soon as I can make time, but since my insurance is pretty awful to non existent I was hoping someone may have some advice.

Heart Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/heart-health/5075/left-ventricle-aneurysms,left ventricle aneurysms,"I'm an otherwise healthy, fit 66 year old woman who inherited high blood pressure (and controls it with medication). I have no coronary artery disease, but a recent cardiac MRI showed 2 aneurysms in the wall of my left ventricle which probably account for the TIA I experienced 2 months ago that led to wearing an event monitor that fortunately recorded an episode of wide-complex ventricular tachycardia (heart rate over 220), for which I luckily converted back to normal sinus rhythm on my own. Only once before (6 months ago) did I experience this strange, dizzying v-tach. And now I have a defibrillator implant because my risk for cardiac arrest is high. But I'm wondering if anyone else has aneurysms in the wall of a ventricle as your primary disease, and how you are treating it. My LV ejection fraction is on the low end of normal. My cardiology team is not sure what to expect and plans to repeat the cardiac MRI in 6-12 months. My MDs are also seeking info about patients similar to me through their networks.","Heart Failure , Heart Disease"
Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/153/ibs-c,IBS-C,"I was first diagnosed, by elimination, with IBS-C when I was in my 30s. From that time on I suffered occasional flares but usually in times of heay stress. About 18 months ago I began to have the flares more often and more severe. I eventually went to a GI doctor who, after a colonoscopy with biopsies came back clear, treated me with Amitiza 8mg, 1 twice a day, Bentyl 20 mg, 1 three times a day, and Ativan, 5 mg, 1 twice a day. This combination worked well for a period of time but then I began to suffer from bouts of diarrhea. It got to where I was moving back and forth between the two extremes most of the time. I asked my regular physician to take over the maintenance of my treatment. He asked me a lot of questions about how I felt and what was a regular routine was like for me. After his examination of my situation he took me off the Bentyl because he thought that it seemed to have made my digestive system too sluggish. He also did a blood panel test and discovered that my thyroid was severly underactive and my Vitamin D was very low. He put me on Synthroid 100 mcg, 1 a day, and Vitamin D3 5000 units, 2 a day. After a couple of weeks I began to see a difference in the way I felt overall. That relieved some of the stress I had been feeling which helped with the IBS. I have been experiencing some pain in my lower back with tingling especially in my right leg. I don't know if it is at all related to the other problems I have. I would appreciate any tips for handling IBS that anyone has discovered. I know pretty much what not to eat but I haven't found any type of IBS diet advising as to what to eat. Any ideas on that would be appreciated also. Thank you....",Irritable Bowel Syndrome

I had severe Gerd and had the Nissin Fundoplication surgery about 18 yrs ago. This surgery worked very well for about 15 yrs and then over time my Gerd came back and is now very serious. I take Prilosec and Zofran (chronic nausea) daily. I also have many serious health issues and must take a variety of other daily meds as well (up to 23 total pills per day!). I am 64 yrs old. Among all my health issues, I've had a variety of surgeries including Gall Bladder removal about 4 yrs ago (I was really sick with 'it' for about 18 mos-was so glad to have it removed!) and I have Chronic Pancreatitis (so many excrutiating episodes landing me in the hospital for days at a time. I was hospitalized with pancreatitis every single month for 8 straight months a few years ago! Ugh!). Recently with my throat so sore, red and feeling swollen on the inside, my Doctor diagnosed me with LPR (Laryngopharyngeal Reflux Disease). My Dr. told me to raise the head of my bed (on wooden blocks-about 16 inches off the ground)-done! I've been doing some 'research' on myself-trying to discover what meds, if any, may be causing this severity of symptoms. I have missed doses of 'these 6 or 7 meds' and only taken 'these two meds' (this is just for example of course!) in order to find any one or two med that may be the ultimate culprit for this severity. It appears to be Lamictal and Trazodone (that I must take at bedtime every day for my Bi-polar disorder) that is causing the most serious symptoms of my acid reflux/LPR. I am wondering if these two meds alone could be causing me all this throat/voice box/larnyx pain and burning as well the regular symptoms of Gerd (nausea, heartburn, stomach pain etc.). I am actually in a predictament if these two meds are the cause as these two meds in combination work so well for my Bi-polar and I would not/would refuse to rock that boat! What to do? And could these two meds be the actual and only cause-that if I stopped taking them this severe LPR would go away? Oh my...","GERD and Heartburn , Irritable Bowel Syndrome"

Sexual Health & STDs,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/1251/feeling-alone-and-afraid-during-painful-periods,Feeling Alone and Afraid During Painful Periods,"I started having my period around the age of thirteen. They used to be the worst pain I could've ever imagined, sometimes immobilizing me during really bad attacks. I'd sob and yell and feel so sick, and I can remember the women in the office telling me to ""suck it up"" because I'd be dealing with periods for a long time. At the time, I knew they weren't understanding that I wasn't being a baby. I was in serious distress with unbearable nausea, back-aches, and cramps, and it happened every month like clockwork. I'd been checked for ovarian cysts, but the doctors came up empty handed every time. Every month, I had another week of being told to just deal with it. Now, I'm twenty, almost twenty-one, and now, I know that this was absolutely not ""normal,"" and I was most certainly not being a baby. For about four years, my periods began to calm down. They became much more irregular, but I no longer had the extreme symptoms I'd had early on. Last year, I had the perfect periods. Still a little unpredictable, but only by a couple days at most, manageable pain levels, and significantly less nausea. And then in December of 2015, I began having extreme abdominal pain in my lower right quadrant. After some tests in the ER, they found I had a large cyst on my right ovary, wrote me a prescription for pain medicine, and told me to make a follow up appointment with a gynecologist soon to get it monitored. I asked about surgery and the Nurse Practitioner I had told me I wasn't a candidate. The next day, I went to the gyno and he told me it was too large to go away on it's own and, in fact, would require immediate surgery. The next day, I was in an operating room, having a panic attack as they put me under. After my periods normalized again, I became extremely irregular again. Now, I'm nearly regular, but dealing with the same extreme pain I used to feel as a young teenager, with the difference being it's always isolated to my ovaries. No cramps, just ovarian pain. I spend nights during this pain curled up crying and days wishing it would just be over. During my last period, I went to the doctor and they'd found a ruptured cyst on my left ovary. They told me to get onto birth control to control the cysts. But I've always been wary of hormonal birth control because of side effects. I've had a lot of issues with mental health and do not want to risk the mood effects and weight gain that typically comes with it. With all of this being said, I feel completely alone one week out of every month. I'm afraid my symptoms will get worse and I'll be back in an operating room and wake up with both of my ovaries gone and no chance at conceiving naturally when I want kids in the future. Over the past few months, as the pain and symptoms during my periods got worse, my closest friend was always there, comforting me. Even as a man, he understood that the pain I was feeling was real and awful. The times I cried on his chest, he was nothing but gentle and understanding and would hold me tight and tell me it was okay and he was there, which always came as a surprise considering the flippant attitude I got from other women and healthcare professionals. But now that he's moved back to his hometown, I'm lost. I'm dealing with the awful pain and the emotional hell it brings me to, and I have no one to help me stand when I feel I've fallen.  Does anyone else experience these things? Can anyone help me understand what's going on, or at least help me not feel so alone?",Women's Issues

I am healthy, active (exercise about 6 days a week), with a 12% body fat (which is respectable for my age and weight). So for the past few months I started noticing the following: my erections are not what they used to be. I hadn't had sex in a few month until I tried to have sex with a girl that I met. The first night we had sex I got a pretty solid erection and we were able to have intercourse for about 10 minutes until I became flaccid. And recently when we tried again, i was rock hard while we were making out but after i took my clothes off the election just faded. She even tried giving me a BJ but still nothing. It is probably the worst feeling a man can have, and the most embarrassing too. I also try not to masturbate, but when I do it's with porn and I should probably avoid it. Even then, my erections when I masturbate are not 100%. I went to the doctor to get a testosterone test and I got a 539, which I looked up and it's not a low level. My erections just do not last, or I just do not get them at all. Sometimes I'll get hard by just looking at my girl and random boners (they're still not 100%) but I wonder why I can't get it up for interrcourse or masturbation.  Additionally, work and school has been really hectic, leaving me w an average of 4-5hrs of sleep a night which I read that could be an issue, since I am exercising vigorously, working and going to school and my body is not able to recover as it should. Again, I have noticed that my erections have not been where they should for the past 5 months and it is not a new issue. I spoke to my girl about it and she understands, but I'm scared she will leave me.  Has anyone else gone through this? What helped you? What can I do to help facilitate this? Is sleeping the real culprit of this situation? My people, please help!  Any feedback will be GREATLY appreciated, thanks!",

They gave me chicken broth soup the day after the operation and I got sick and felt like throwing up, they put a probe into my nose and pumped the soup out.  When I got back home I had terrible chest pain and went back for x ray, they said that gullet was swollen and changed my medication, for the pain they gave me ketorolac and Toradol but it gave me an anxiety attack.  Then I went to see a gastroenterologist and had Barium X ray on an empty stomach, Lungs and heart were consistent with the age and norm. Gullet was passing barium meal well, walls were elastic, wrinkles were evident, right angled. Stomach is in shape of a hook, is expanding normally, there is a lot of secretion in the cavity, is puffed up. Shape on large curvature is looking simpler, plain. Mucus shape is deformed, poor. Peristalsis is of average depth, equal. Evacuation of the contrast is timely. Duodenum bulb is deformed. Regurgitation is evident.  In horisontal state hiatal hernia relapse is not shown.  Conclusion was that I have acute gastritis, duodenal gastric reflux.

I eat three times a day every four hours and when chest pain is bit lessened when I eat it worsens again. I feel pain in my breast bone and most of times it reaches my heart and the sensation is like I can’t breath and I am suffocating, when I belch it seems to relieve the pain for a second.

Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/35810/perfectly-spherical-poop-maybe-a-tumor,Perfectly spherical poop (maybe a tumor?),"I regularly experienced stomach sickness throughout my childhood and young adult years. By the time I reached high school I experienced stomach discomfort on almost a daily basis with a few times it was so debilitating that I could barely walk. There were times when I would almost crap in my pants – I didn’t even know it was coming until the hershey squirt happened. When I look back at this time, I’m amazed I was able to play and excel at sports – I think it was the adrenaline that seemed to lessen the chronic pain and discomfort. My parents had initially blamed this on me being susceptible to stomach viruses but it became such a regular issue that they brought me to the hospital for tests (blood tests, kidney tests – had to drink something that I forgot the name of, and an enema followed by a colonoscopy). But they never actually looked at my stomach. It ended up that I tested positive for “mono”. The doctors didn’t see anything else from the tests so they blamed it on “mono”. But I never knew why mono was an explanation for stomach pains. But the problem never went away even after I recovered from mono. After that I just hid my symptoms from my family and friends (mostly because I was afraid that my parents wouldn’t let me compete in sports). I was experiencing some sort of stomach pain almost every day when I got to college. I was actually used to it and could function as a student but had to stop playing sports – I just wasn’t healthy enough to regularly compete at a high level. I also had a few really bad painful stomach experiences. On one occasion my dorm mates had to call an ambulance. But the university infirmary didn’t do much other then give me some pain killers and tagamet. To make a long story much shorter, after I graduated college, the painful stomach episodes became more frequent. I had a reoccurring stabbing pain in my stomach that seemed to move into my bowels. Basically the doctors prescribed ulcer medication which didn't really work. Then one day I had the most excruciatingly painful bowel movement in my life. I felt like my anus was being ripped apart. What came out shocked me. It was a perfectly spherical ball – seemed about the size of a baseball. It was heavier than a normal poop - it made a weird splash and thud when it hit the bottom of the bowl. It also had a series of perfectly round extruding nodules that completely covered the ball in a symmetrical pattern. When I looked down at that thing and the blood - I was completely scarred and flushed it. If I didn’t know better, I would say it was man-made because of the perfect shape. I’ve always regretted not taking it out of the toilet for testing. But did I flush some sort of cancerous tumor down the toilet that was working its way slowly out of my body’s digestive system? Has any medical professional ever heard of large perfectly spherical poop with symmetrical nodules? I’m saying poop but for all I know it was a tumor. Sorry if this sounds strange but this issue has been on my mind for years and I decided to just ask because I can’t find anyone ever experiencing a similar situation on the internet. I never asked for a medical opinion on what happened because I was so fearful of the tumor issue. On the bright side, my stomach symptoms left after that day and haven’t returned in over 20 years.",

I will continue to read more when I have the time. Most of what I found seemed to show that traditional treatments on their own do not work as well, and present a high probability for reoccurence. I see that the use of vitamin C, as outlined specifically in the first study (try to follow it as they had done in the trials with subjects for an effective outcome) works well, cutting the reoccurence of an outbreak in half. I've outlined the details for instruction of use.  Additionally, the use of traditional medical therapy to treat BV, specifically Metronidazole and Clindamycin, AS WELL AS with alternative therapies seems to show a lot of promise. I've outlined the alternative therapies and everything else in detail.  I really hope this helps! I've been trying to find as many evidence-based studies as I can. Specifically ones that focus on isolating the specific bacteria that's at the source BV, and the biofilm that is the TRUE reason for recurrent outbreaks. I feel very thankful that scientists are actively working to find effective treatment for this problem that supposedly doesn't have a cure. Hope is on the horizon! Proposed BV Treatment options [[My personal notes are in double brackets]] Study name: Efficacy of Vitamin C Vaginal Tablets as Prophylaxis for Recurrent Bacterial Vaginosis: A Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial; Vladislav N. Krasnopolskya, Vera N. Prilepskayab, Franco Polattic, Nina V. Zarochentsevaa, Guldana R. Bayramovab, Maurizio Caserinid, Renata Palmierid, e -Treatment overview during trials: Within 24 hours of cure from a recent episode of BV by metronidazole or clindamycin, implement vitamin C for six consecutive monthly cycles. Each cycle consists of inserting one vaginal tablet for 6 consecutive days during each month following menses [[Use with tampon to keep the vitamin C inside]]. -Tablets are 250mg ascorbic acid [[though many women on various forums have claimed to use 500 mg with success]] in a silicone carrier that ensures prolonged action [[find one without added sugars, such as Twinlab C-500 Caps, Crystalline Vitamin C capsules]]. -[[No statistical significance was noted within the 3-month period, only becoming apparent during month 5. Conclusion was that the regular use of the tablets for the suggested duration following the success of metronidazole treatment reduces the reoccurrence rate from 32.4% to 16.2%.]] “A therapeutic approach in the treatment of BV relapse is to re-establish and maintain the physiological acidity of the vagina, as the growth of anaerobes and other faecal bacteria is inhibited by low pH. Attempts to achieve this via re-colonisation with exogenous lactobacilli have not been successful. Another, more accepted approach is to reduce vaginal pH, in order to create a negative environment for pathogen growth and to achieve long-lasting normalisation of vaginal flora using intravaginal ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The use of antibiotics may induce resistance in the pool of bacteria recognised to cause BV and, conversely, could affect the normal flora of lactobacilli [9], favouring recurrence within a few weeks in over 70% of women taking antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [18]. Ascorbic acid [[250 mg, in a silicone carrier that ensures prolonged action]] plays a vital role in maintaining low vaginal pH values and enhances healing processes in the vaginal ecosystem - recolonisation with lactic acid bacteria. The mechanism of action is simple: through the lowering of vaginal pH to the physiological level of 3.8 - 4.5, anaerobic overgrowth is inhibited and the conditions for the re-growth of physiological lactobacilli flora are re-established. “ “The results of the present study show that 250 mg ascorbic acid vaginal tablets taken 6 days per month safely halves the risk of BV recurrence from 32.4% to 16.2% during a 6-month prophylactic treatment. The O.R. confirms that subjects treated with placebo had a doubled risk of BV recurrence compared with the group of subjects treated with vitamin C. Considering the time to the first BV relapse, treatment of at least five cycles is necessary in order to reduce, at a significant level, the risk of BV recurrence. As this was a prophylaxis study, in women who at the screening visit were healthy and who terminated the study in case of relapse, a between-treatment difference in clinical parameters was not expected. At the same time, differences in pH were not expected but conversely, a reduction in pH was noted for 3-month and 6-month treatment. “ In conclusion, regular use of silicon-coated vitamin C (250 mg) tablets, after the standard antibiotic treatment for BV, protects women by reducing the risk of recurrence probably by re-establishing the normal lactobacilli flora that is able to maintain vaginal pH.” Study name: Bacterial Vaginosis Biofilms: Challenges to Current Therapies and Emerging Solutions; Daniela Machado1, Joana Castro1,2, Ana Palmeira-de-Oliveira3,4, José Martinez-de-Oliveira3,5 and Nuno Cerca1* “Being polymicrobial in nature, BV etiology remains unclear. However, it is certain that BV involves the presence of a thick vaginal multi-species biofilm, where G. vaginalis is the predominant species. Similar to what happens in many other biofilm-related infections, standard antibiotics, like metronidazole, are unable to fully eradicate the vaginal biofilm, which can explain the high recurrence rates of BV. Furthermore, antibiotic therapy can also cause a negative impact on the healthy vaginal microflora. These issues sparked the interest in developing alternative therapeutic strategies. This review provides a quick synopsis of the currently approved and available antibiotics for BV treatment while presenting an overview of novel strategies that are being explored for the treatment of this disorder, with special focus on natural compounds that are able to overcome biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance.” Current available treatments: Metronidazole and clindamycin are shown to be effective against anaerobic microorganisms, though tinidazole was the most recently approved antimicrobial agent for BV treatment, and is considered an alternative antimicrobial agent, particularly whenever metronidazole and clindamycin are unavailable or not tolerated. Being a second generation nitroimidazole with a longer half-life than metronidazole, it requires lower dosages, to be taken less frequently than metronidazole. Although antibiotics are effective against anaerobic microorganisms, the have an inability to completely eradicate the densely-structured polymicrobial BV biofilms-associated bacteria G. Vaginalis. Alternative solutions: Probiotics have been shown to modulate vaginal microbiota”: “In the human vagina, certain Lactobacillus strains can act as probiotics, preventing the growth of BV-associated bacteria through two main mechanisms: the inhibition of pathogens adhesion to vaginal epithelium (Machado et al., 2013); and the production of antimicrobial compounds like hydrogen peroxide (Mastromarino et al., 2002), lactic acid (Boskey et al., 2001) and bacteriocins (Aroutcheva et al., 2001b). Diverse pharmaceutical formulations containing probiotic lactobacilli strains have reduced BV symptoms, improved the vaginal microflora profile, being usually well-tolerated (Rossi et al., 2010;Hantoushzadeh et al., 2012; Facchinetti et al., 2013; Vujic et al., 2013; Vicariotto et al., 2014). “ “In contrast, despite their therapeutic potential, some clinical trials have not detected a significant improvement in BV management (Falagas et al., 2007). Alternatively, probiotics have been proposed as adjuvants to antibiotic therapy [[meaning, using probiotics following the use of antibiotics]]. Several combinations of metronidazole, clindamycin or tinidazole with lactobacilli probiotic preparations have displayed promising results in BV treatment since they have been associated with high cure rates, low recurrence or quick re-establishment of an healthy vaginal microflora (Marcone et al., 2010; Bodean et al., 2013; Recine et al., 2016).” “Probiotics have also been used in an attempt to specifically deal with BV biofilms. Remarkably, in 2007, Saunders and colleagues showed that L. reuteri RC-14 was able to disruptin vitro G. vaginalis biofilms (Saunders et al., 2007). Later, McMillan and colleagues demonstrated that probiotic L. reuteri RC-14 and L. rhamnosus GR-1 were able to incorporate themselves into BV-biofilm, composed by G. vaginalis and A. vaginae, causing both the disruption of the biofilm structure and bacterial cell death (McMillan et al., 2011). These findings provide some evidence of how lactobacilli probiotics might interfere with an abnormal vaginal microflora, reinforcing the hypothesis that probiotics could eradicate vaginal pathogenic biofilms and restore the normal microflora in in vivo situations.” “It has also been proposed that prebiotics [[such as the product Multigyn FloraPlus]], nutritional substances that stimulate the growth of probiotics, could be used as alternative to treat BV (Roberfroid, 2007). Interestingly, Rousseau and colleagues demonstrated that prebiotic preparations containing oligosaccharides were able to promote the growth of beneficial lactobacilli strains but not of the pathogenic microorganisms often found in urogenital infections including G. vaginalis (Rousseau et al., 2005). “ “Later, Zeng and colleagues compared the efficacy of a prebiotic gel containing sucrose with 0.75% metronidazole vaginal gel to treat BV (Zeng et al., 2010). In that study, the prebiotic gel displayed a similar therapeutic cure rate to metronidazole, having a major advantage of quicker restoration of the normal vaginal microflora. Recently, Coste and colleagues evaluated the efficacy and safety of another prebiotic gel, applied as adjuvant therapy [[combined with antibiotic treatment]], in women treated for BV and showed an improved recovery of the normal vaginal flora, reducing the risk of recurrences (Coste et al., 2012). Plant-derived compounds: “Surprisingly, up to now only one study evaluated the capability of plant-derived compound to eradicate BV biofilms. Interestingly, Braga and colleagues showed that thymol, a molecule present in thyme essential oil, had an inhibitory effect upon both newly formed and mature G. vaginalis biofilms, which supports the importance of exploring essential oils and their main constituents as therapeutic alternative to treat BV (Braga et al., 2010). Furthermore, the expectations on essential oils as effective agents against BV-biofilms can be inferred from studies in other related vaginal biofilms (Palmeira-de-Oliveira et al., 2012; Bogavac et al., 2015).” [[The suggested delivery was through douche]]. Acidifying/buffering agents: -“Recently, Bahamondes and colleagues verified that a soap containing lactic acid and lactoserum could be used for external intimate hygiene, reducing BV recurrence after treatment with oral metronidazole (Bahamondes et al., 2011). “ -“Interestingly, vitamin C, when coated with silicon, allowed the constant release of the active agent, resulting in a long-lasting vaginal low pH and prevention of vaginal irritation (Polatti et al., 2006). Other studies reported an effective and safe use of vaginal vitamin C tablets in BV treatment (Petersen et al., 2011), contributing to improve abnormal vaginal pH and microflora, especially in pregnant women (Zodzika et al., 2013). Additionally, the regular use of vitamin C during 6 days per month, for 6 months after successful BV treatment, was shown to decrease the risk of BV recurrence (Krasnopolsky et al., 2013).  -“Another alternative comes in the form of buffering agents. Polycarbophil [[like the product Replens]] is a weak poly-acid that it is able to adhere to vaginal epithelial cells, acting as a buffer in the vaginal secretions (Milani et al., 2000). “ -“Another agent that has been long used in the treatment of vaginal infections is boric acid (Van Slyke et al., 1981) [[This could be the 600 mg tablets from brands pH-D, BoriCap, Bona Dea, or Boric Balance as of a recent Google search]]. Recently, Reichman and colleagues reported that the use of boric acid in combination with a nitroimidazole reduce the BV recurrence (Reichman et al., 2009), suggesting a potential impact on BV biofilms. However, this need to be further studied and in vitro biofilm experiments will elucidate the role of boric acid in BV prevention.” Conclusions and future directions: BV current approved therapies are not sufficient to deal with this multi-species biofilm-related vaginal disorder. Future, research should address biofilm communities with a particular emphasis on multi-species biofilms, a topic that only recently emerged (Castro and Cerca, 2015). By properly addressing the complex interactions established in multi-species biofilms, novel strategies will hopefully overcome the high recurrence and relapse rates associated with BV.",Women's Issues

It's difficult to know exactly when I contracted it, but my guess is almost two years ago. I had a few instances of mild symptoms consisting of a single itchy lesion which was diagnosed as felicitous on at least 3 different occasions. Finally, the fourth doctor I saw about it said lets do a herpes test just in case... sure enough, the swab test pointed to HSV-2. I was pretty surprised, as every time in the past I had this issue I was given antibiotics and the condition cleared up almost immediately, pointing to a non-viral cause.  Anyway, since my diagnosis I started taking 500mg of valacyclovir once in the morning and once in the evening. I was still experiencing mildish symptoms, so my doctor advised me to take 1500mg/day. Symptoms got a little better, but still there, so I've been taking 1g in the morning and 1g at night (4 500mg pills a day) for about two weeks now. I haven't had any obvious lesions, but I experience tingling/itching throughout the day- sometimes more sometimes less. It's hard to tell if there are lesions present or not- I might think I see a tiny bump at the epicentre of an itchy spot but then I think maybe it's just in my head.  I've done a lot of research about the condition and the way diet can effect it, specifically the relationship between outbreaks and Arginine/Lysine level in the diet. I've been extremely vigilant about trying to eliminate high Arginine food while increasing high Lysine food in my diet, as well as trying to focus on alkalising my body with lemon/baking soda/apple cider vinegar drinks and lots of leafy greens.  However, despite my valacyclovir regiment and healthy diet, I'm still experiencing persistent, though mild, symptoms and naturally it's become extremely frustrating.  I've suffered from cold sores since I was a child, though I haven't had one in over a year, and I understand this is something I will have to deal with for the rest of my life... It would just be nice if it would go away for at least some period of time and I could feel normal for a moment. I could deal with the occasional outbreak, but am I going to have to think about this every day? Thanks for reading- any information/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",Genital Herpes

I have had severe abdominal pain for almost four days now and after multiple tests and visits the hospital has still not been able to identify the issue. The pain was accompanied by three vomits over the first two days, one occurring directly after being given Tramadol IV. The pain is a constant cramp-like feeling, similar to labour pain, occuring in the mid-to-lower section of my belly. Tummy exams over the last few days have shown varying degrees of tenderness, sometimes barely any, sometimes tenderness towards the lower right side and sometimes to the middle left side. Nausea and loss of appetite are almost constant, though i suspect it has been somewhat a side effect of the strong painkillers. A list of tests that have returned normal include; Multiple bloods, urine tests (including multiple standard pregnancy tests), abdominal ultrasound, transvaginal ultrasound, abdominal CT scan. A list of issues that have been ruled out as highly unlikely at this stage are; Pregnancy, Appendicitis, Ovarian cysts, Urinary Tract Infection. I have an Implanon contraceptive in my left arm and as a side effect hadn't experienced a period for over a year. I have been to hospital now three times. -The first time I was admitted. They ran a series of small tests (bloods, urine, stomach exams) as they suspected possible appendicitis. To manage my pain, which was about LVL 7/10, they gave me IV Tramadol, which increased my nausea (I vomited immediately after) but covered the pain successfully.  All test results came back normal, so they suspected it was simply due to some gastrointestinal upset. They gave me a script for Paracetamol/Codeine and Ibuprofen for pain management and sent me home aprox 3am from the Emergency Dep. -At home. Still under the effects of Tramadol, I was able to sleep for a few hours. The pain began to gradually return once I woke. I went to the chemist with my script as soon as they opened, then began taking the Paracetamol/Codeine (still very nauseous, I couldn't stomach any food so I was unable to take the Ibuprofen at the time). Passed a normal stool. -My second time to emergency.  It became clear that the Paracetamol/Codeine was not effective and pain level slowly returned in full so I returned to the Emergency Dep around midday. I experienced mild cold sweats and I vomited a large amount of yellowish-slightly green bile while waiting to be attended. I was given oral Tramadol and an anti nausea tablet. After a tummy exam resulted in tenderness in the lower right region I was put on IV fluids and was fasted in case of appendicitis. They then followed up with the Abdominal ultrasound and Transvaginal ultrasound which came back normal. I was then moved to a ward for overnight observation. During my time in the Observation Ward I continued being given a dose of Tramadol, paracetamol and an anti nausea tablet six hourly or so, when the pain began to return. I was assessed by the Ward's surgeons and they agreed that based on the normal results gained from all my tests that they didn't believe I required any kind of surgery and that I could come off of fasting and IV fluids. They proposed that I stay the night under observation, try and eat and drink and see how I progressed. If nothing else occurred overnight then I'd likely be able to go home in the morning. After speaking with me they sent me for a CT scan, which came back normal too, I then spent the night in the Obs Ward. Received an anti clotting injection to my thigh, apparently standard precautionary protocol for Obs patients as they're at risk of developing DVT. At the suggestion of the night shift Nurse I then started taking Oxycodone and paracetamol instead of Tramadol to see if it it made me less nauseous (which it did, worked wonders and helped me sleep). Re-assessed by doctors in the morning, they admitted that they didn't know what the issue was but suspected some kind of gastrointestinal issue that should pass. They prescribed me ten Oxycodone to take home for pain management. Before being discharged I noticed I had slight vaginal bleeding, which I notified the nurses of. One nurse suggested that it could have been caused by repeated blood pressure bands being placed on top of the Implanon, interrupting it's normal function. There is also the fairly reasonable possibility that the Transvaginal ultrasound may have caused mild bleeding. I was then discharged. -At home. I slept when I arrived home, but awoke with returned pain of around LVL 4/10. I had a lacy red rash over my chest and shoulders, I thought perhaps a heat rash as I woke fairly warm in my bed (it was the middle of the day). I then took my next dose of Oxycodone and paracetamol two and a half hours early. Over the next hour the pain rose slowly to a LVL 5/10 before the Oxycodone seemed to kick in but only took it back down to LVL 4/10. Over this time mild vaginal bleeding continued. I returned to the Emergency Dep because I was afraid the Oxycodone wasn't going to work and I didn't want to wait until it got bad again and spend several hours in agony waiting to be seen. -Third emergency dep. visit. The triage nurse gave me two Ibuprofen/Codeine. I sat down to wait with a pain LVL 4/10. By time I was taken into the Emergency ward the Ibuprofen had brought my pain down to a really good level, varying between non existent and LVL 3/10 depending on how much I was moving. I waited in the Emergency Ward for a few hours, it was very busy, and was briefly assessed by a nurse who suggested that the Ibuprofen/Codeine may have eased the pain because it was an anti-inflammatory drug rather than just a painkiller. I ended up leaving before being assessed by a doctor as my pain was under control and I didn't feel confident that I needed emergency treatment. -At Home. I returned home to continue treating myself for pain with the medication I had. I have continued taking Oxycodone every six hours, and taking the ED nurse's idea on board I've been taking one Ibuprofen 400g three hours after the Oxycodone to take the edge off.  It has worked quite well so far and I'm hoping this will help to keep the pain at bay. Vaginal bleeding has increased slightly, though certainly not alarmingly. This is pretty much where I stand with it all. I'm feeling ok, my pain is being successfully managed. I'm eating small amounts of plain foods when taking the Ibuprofen and drinking plenty of water. I'm just afraid of what will happen if the pain continues at the heights it has been at whilst continuing to go undiagnosed.   I only have six Oxycodone tablets left, so ideally 36 hours of pain relief remaining unless the pain eases up on it's own (which I'll be super happy about haha) All in all I'm very curious to know if anyone has any ideas of what else to do or has had any experience with a similar issue. I am really eager to get some kind of idea of what is going on. I can't live with the pain and nausea and I can't just keep going to the Emergency Dep every time the painkillers stop working, I really need a solution! Dx Any constructive advice would be much appreciated xxxxxxxx (Also; lol some doctors are really sloppy at putting in cannula, I have a bruise the size of a damn apple on my forearm haha they should leave it to the phlebotomist)","IBD , Crohn's Disease , Ulcers , Irritable Bowel Syndrome , Bloating , Ulcerative Colitis"

Her blood pressure was 160/98. They gave her a GI cocktail and hours later sent her home. The next day we were back in the ER, same scenario. 3 days later we went to the family doctor who gave us a BP log and told us to log it for a week and come back. We didn't make it but 2 days. Within that 2 days she passed out in the hall at school and when someone got her to the office her BP was at 155/108. I picked her up. Her symptoms were pale, shakey, & blurred vision. I took her immediately to her Dr who prescribed her Cozzar 50mg with a .01 Clonidine for emergency's only. That worked for 3 weeks. After the 3 weeks we were back in the ER from school where she passed out again and they admitted her into the hospital for evaluation for 3 days. After the 3 days they still had no idea why she was having the issues and sent her home again and still no answers. Finally we got into a pediatric cardiologist and he wondered why we were there, like he just didn't understand the problem, like it was just normal or something, no big deal, so he sent us to a pediatric neurologist who is treating her for migraines which by the way she doesn't even have. The headaches are real but they are only a problem when the BP is a problem. So we drive an hour away 2 times a week for nothing and another 2 times a week to be treated for migraines. No one is addressing the BP at all. Now all the sudden, the blood pressure is low all the time, like most of the time. Yesterday the school called and I had to pick her up with a BP of 80/62 and she was pale and shakey and couldn't barely stand up. She slept all evening. Then today, they called me and I had to go get her with a BP of 155/111... It doesn't make sense to me. How does a 16 year old girl have hypo and hypertension and how do you treat that? There has to be a cause. That can't be normal. It has to be causing damage to her somewhere down the line. It can't be healthy. No one is doing anything to figure out what the problem is and I know there has to be a reason. I live in Louisiana and there aren't a lot of options here. I've thought of out of state help but idk if our insurance with cover out of state. I know medicaid won't but idk about TriCare. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm stressed and worried. Scared for what's gonna happen to her and no one is helping us. Anything you can tell me would be great. I need some ideas of what to do. Am I freaking out for nothing? Any ideas are appreciated! I will go anywhere I need to go , climb any mountain, cross any ocean, call anyone I need to or drive any amount of miles needed to get her the care she needs. We just need answers so we can know what's wrong and find treatment and learn to live as normal a life as a young girl can with her issues. Thanks for your time!

I've read the Good News About the Bad News and I have been reading numerous articles and forum posts on the subject. I feel that I have started to get a grasp on the situation and what I may be in store for. I'm not completely over feeling the negative aspects of this but I don't feel like I'm in a pit of despair anymore and want to begin to feel better. I have been single for almost a year and I feel prepared to possibly give dating a shot again. In preparation for this and knowing often the asymptomatic shedding occurs, I made an appointment with my doctor to get a prescription for an anti-viral. I was a bit surprised to have my doctor tell me that he was basically just going to prescribe the medication for outbreak management. I have only had two outbreaks in the last three years (from what I know now I was misdiagnosed years ago when I had an initial outbreak and by a dermatologist of all people!) and he used having 6 outbreaks a year as a baseline of whether or not I would need daily suppressive therapy. I pressed him on this further with my concern of transmission to another person as my outbreaks are few and far between and are very mild (at least I can be thankful for that). I was told that as long as I'm using condoms and abstaining when I have outbreaks that I wont transmit it. I didn't feel like arguing with him and I sort of don't feel like I should argue with an experienced medical professional, but I thought this was how the medical community used to handle this (maybe around the 80's and 90's) until they better understood how often shedding occurred. From just about everything I've read that just doesn't seem true and condoms only protect the area they cover leaving everything else vulnerable to transmission. I know even with condoms and medication it is still possible, but the risk is greatly reduced. Does the advice I was given seem out of touch? The only other conclusion I can try to grasp is that because I have such infrequent outbreaks I don't shed as much or there is less of a risk? I have yet to read anything that would back that up. If it does seem off I don't feel like I can tell my doctor to prescribe me more for daily suppressant or that I disagree with his medical advice. Do I go to different doctor and try to explain this or a family planning center? It's such a pain to establish with another doctor and I feel like a dick telling him I think he's not giving me the best info. I was really hoping to feel less burdened by this disease today, but this took the wind out of my sails. I just don't feel that I would be giving a potential future partner the best scenario to prevent infection and makes me feel less confident in putting myself back out there. Do you think going to a family planning center would be better or they would understand where I'm coming from and suggest daily therapy? It seems like they deal with sti's more directly and could be more knowledgeable.","Men's Issues , Genital Herpes"

No bowel issues either. I've started treating the tickle with antacids to see if it does make a difference. Still not sure.

This will be a long post so please bare with me. Over the past 3 years I have been experiencing strange symptoms/episodes infrequently that I believe are related to a combination of dehydration and low-blood sugar but because the incidents have varied so much in severity I have had trouble tracking what the actual issue is. I have not consulted a doctor because of how infrequent and varied the incidents are.  I work in the woods for a living as a forester in Oregon. When these incidents started I was working for a timber company on the coast that had just acquired some work inland on the western slopes of the Cascades. While the ground itself wasn't as steep and rugged as I was used too in the coast range, it was higher elevation and the temperatures were quite a bit higher day to day (One week topped out at 108 deg. F consistently). The first day I experienced one of these incidents I was working in a higher elevation area and it was around 95 degrees. I had left at 5 in the morning from the coast to make it to the inland jobsite at 9 am and had drunken a fair amount of coffee and some water but not nearly enough. I had also only eaten a gas station breakfast sandwich with no plans to eat again until dinner that night. After hiking through some steeper ground, I began to have blurred vision in one eye. It felt like I had a ""floater"" that just wouldn't disappear so I sat down and sipped some water. This continued to a varied degree for about 15 minutes and then dissipated but it was followed with a pretty bad headache coming from the top of my head and my temple. I also felt pretty hungry oddly enough. I took it easy for a little while longer, ate a granola bar, and then continued working. About 10 minutes later I began to feel pretty nauseous and ultimately fell like I was either going to throw up or I needed to have a bowel movement. About an hour later I did the latter and felt better and finished out the day. This didn't happen again for another month or so but when it did, it was under the same conditions in the same area and I ultimately attributed it to not being hydrated enough and started to cut back on my coffee consumption quite a bit and focus on eating and drinking well and the incidents didn't really ever happen again.  After about a year I accepted a job on the eastside of the Cascades where the ground was ultimately way flatter but I was in, again, higher elevations. This position had me in the Office a little more than I expected and definitely more than my previous position where I spent 50-60 hours in the woods a week. I began become more out of shape because I hadn't adjusted my eating habits or began exercising because I had always relied on the work I do to keep me in shape. Every time I would go into the woods in this new position I would over exert myself because I would try and work at the same rate I used too. I began to have the same episodes only I had one that was particularly bad where I had the same blurred vision, headache, and hunger only this time I tried to eat a large lunch after and ultimately ended vomiting. Because of the increased office stress of my new position, I was drinking quite a bit of coffee through out the day and then coping with the caffeine at night with beer (Not a lot of water was being consumed). I had a pretty unbalanced diet with eating next to nothing for breakfast, a medium sized lunch, and then a huge dinner. This has continued until now where I have recently tried to change my habits and get into better shape but the last couple times I have tried to exercise even with adequate water consumption (I have been using the half your weight in ounces rule of thumb) I have the same incident occur and feel like garbage until I sleep it off. It doesn't happen in the woods as much anymore because I don't drink any coffee on those days, drink water consistently throughout the day, and try eat small meals consistently throughout the day. As I am writing this out, I feel like I am answering my own questions but this has really caused me a lot of depression because I am almost afraid to hike in the woods again because I might have one of these episodes and my job is my passion. I worked out for 30 minutes yesterday and felt great until about 15 minutes after I finished when my vision blurred and the whole process started again.  Do any of you guys have suggestions? This happened maybe 10 times across the last 3 years. I am 6'1 and 250 lbs. When I worked on the coast I was around 215. Thank you for your time and help.",

Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/37175/stumped,Stumped,"I've also posted this under skin conditions, as none of the categories appear to match my situation: I never do this, as the internet is the worst place to research health conditions, but my doctor, and every specialist I see is stumped. I'm hoping that someone here may have either experienced this, or has seen something similar. I'm a middle aged, fair complected man, but my problems are much more than skin deep. Please read my description, and let me know your thoughts.  About March of 2017, I noticed that I was running a daily low grade fever (typically around 101.1). My wife was ill, and the only reason I noted the change was because I was being diligent in not wanting to bring an infection home. Around May of that same year, my children were asking me what the spots were on my head. At the time, I laughed it off as a joke, but eventually, my eldest took a picture of what he was talking about (it was on the back of my head). The images both shocked and scared me. I am balding, and have been since my 20's, so hair hasn't been a priority for years. I typically shave, or keep my hair extremely short. I'm also redheaded, so what I'm about to describe is bizarre. I was developing dark patches of hair (semi-circular) on my scalp. I immediately saw my GP, fearing the worst. He told me that the skin was normal, but the hair itself was turning dark brown or black (hyperpigmentation). He stated that he had never seen something present like this. While I was there, I discussed the fever, and some other symptoms I had been having. I've had various levels of pain in my abdomen, as well as pain in a spot in the right side of my throat (which I think may be deferred from the chest), as well as fatigue and a general sense of being unwell. He stated that it might be stress, but that whatever it was, appeared inflammatory. At that time, I was also having one of the worst acne flare ups I've had since I was in my teens - I'm in my 40's now.  The doctor indicated that it might be a form of lupus, and referred me to a rheumatologist. They were not in agreement, due to other symptoms not being present, but indicated that the darkening may relate to the acne. Well it's been several months now, the acne has cleared up, but the fever, pain, and darkening of my hair continue. I don't want to exaggerate, but I look like a dalmation, and I don't know the cause. Additionally, I'm tired of feeling like hell. I've had numerous tests, and quite frankly, I'm not made of money. That said, I'm worried that if I back off, I may be ignoring something serious. I've searched the web tirelessly over the past several months, and nothing matches what I'm seeing.

All of his brothers except for one that died young had already been treated. My grandfather on that side was also treated. There is obviously a strong genetic risk for me so am concerned about my risk in the future. I am seeing conflicting reports about the frequency of ejaculation and prostate cancer risk. Some suggest that those that ejaculate 21 or more times per month have a lower risk. I am probably somewhere between 60 and 80 times per month. I apparently have a very strong sex drive for my age (37) which appears to be both good and bad for prostate cancer risk. Then there are studies saying that frequent masturbation (2-7 times weekly) in the teens and twenties shows increased risk of prostate cancer. I was taking care of myself 2-7 times per day at this age, day after day, so well above the norm. Again, my drive was probably at the strong end of the spectrum at that time as well. I understand that frequent ejaculation helps clear out toxins in the prostate but also is a sign of high testosterone levels which can trigger the cancer.

Can I get eye herpes from touching faucet and then using finger to get eye booger out of my inner eye immediately after?,"Let's say the faucet handle was wet and this person that has active sores used the faucet one hour prior. I come along to wash my hands with soap and water in a sink [that also has dirty dishes in it] and water on the faucet handle and then I turn off the faucet. Immediately after, while at the sink, I use a finger to extract an eye booger from the inner corner of my eye. Can I get eye herpes from this given the time frame and circumstance (wet faucet handle/soiled dishes that might have splattered)? The person I live with has oral and eye herpes. His first episode was after visiting a dentist many years ago and was confirmed as herpes by a doctor. He has a bad immune system and is older so he often has breakouts and generally always has some kinds of sores on his face. I've read multiple things about how long it can live outside of the body and cause transmission. One is that herpes cannot live on dead surfaces for more than 10 seconds, but I've also read it can live on non porous solid objects for 4-8 hours (like a faucet) and wet cloth for 2-4 hours and dry cloth for 15 minutes. Not sure what to go by and what my risk is considering it was a wet solid object and I immediately stuck my finger in my eye but it was an hour after the sink was last used. I don't want to make him feel bad about it so I don't bring it up but I'm crashing here for a little bit and when things like this occur I worry about transmission. It's not usually the first thing on my mind though so I do things like shut off the faucet and then rub my eyes thinking, 'oh, i just washed my hands so they're clean and I can clean my eyes,' and then start to worry ten minutes later realizing I didn't do the most sanitary thing and could have exposed myself to it.",

We've been somewhat rough at times, but again, it doesn't consistently happen, so I don't know if that's the cause. I don't feel any pain or discomfort and can never tell when it's happening. I have been to my doctor twice now - back in May and about 2 weeks ago. She has done a Pap both times, both which came back normal. Also was tested for STDs, that all came back negative, as well Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida species, and Trichomonas vaginalis by DNA Probe (not entirely sure what those are) but again, all came back negative.  She did mention that my cervix was inflammed, but couldn't give me an exact reason why. During both of my Pap smears, I started bleeding as well; which she mentioned isnt abnormal. But knowing that I've experienced bleeding during sex as well as the Pap smear, I wasn't sure if there could be a common denominator between them? She said a little blood during a pap isn't uncommon, and said something about the lining being thin?  With that being said, after going to the doctors twice, I still don't have an answer as to why this is happening and what the next steps I should be taking are.

In college I was on the muscular/heavy side (190 lbs at 5'11""). The last few years I went through periods of high stress and have dropped to 170 or less at times. I have periodic episodes of chronic stomach pain that feel like the cramps you get in the early stages of the stomach flu (no throwing up though). These cramps are usually triggered by periods of eating spicy food and/or milk (I was lactose intolerant as a child). They can also be accompanied by some bleeding when eliminating. The blood appears on the surface of the stool and will sometimes drip afterwards.  Just recently I had blood-work done as a part of a life insurance application. The results showed that I have lower than normal AST, GGT, Total Protein, Albumin, and Cholesteral. After reading a bit it appears that the only worrisome result is the low protein and albumin levels. My globulin level is normal, so I'm guessing that the abnormality in the total protein is all the fault of my albumin level which is 3.5 g/dL. Are these simply symptoms of under eating and high stress that can be remedied by just eating more and avoiding foods that I'm sensitive to, or would it appear that there are some more serious issues going on here. I generally feel healthy and can keep up a high level of physical activity, but its hard for me to gain weight when I'm not working out a lot and I sit behind a computer all day for work.","IBD , Crohn's Disease , Ulcers , Irritable Bowel Syndrome"

Based on my symptoms he suspected Crohn's and wanted to check for colitis. I had a colonoscopy that looked great and he suggested repeat colonoscopy every 2 years.  My anus area became very irritated, itchy, skin tags, hemorrhoids. I was able to get in with another (closer) colorectal surgeon in early January and she diagnosed me with Pruritis Ani and prescribed me a topical ointment and diet to follow to assist with healing; however she did not want to rule out Crohn's yet based on family history, what she had noticed, etc. She stated sometimes it can start in other areas before it makes an appearance in the rectum, colon, etc (Metastatic Crohn's?) After about 2 weeks there was great improvement and I was almost back to 100%. I reintroduced a few of my normal foods. For the rest of the story, all cramps include entire abdomen in pain, chills only during cramping, having me doubled over, and make me dizzy/lightheaded: Saturday, 1/27/18 I began having cramps and diarrhea. That evening I was very cold and could not seem to get warm and had the chills. I assumed a stomach bug. Monday, 1/29/18 I missed work due to being up most of the night Sunday with cramps and going to the bathroom. I was in pain, tired, weak. Walking from one room to another would make me light headed. I tried to rest as much as possible. Tuesday, 1/30/18 evening noticed that when I wipe after each time I had diarrhea, there was a snot like/mucus texture and color was getting to kind of yellowy. Wednesday, 1/31/18 diarrhea still has mucous texture and when I wipe it yellowish tint on toilet paper. Also observed the stool hanging from anus and slimily falling into the toilet. This makes 5 days of cramping and gas and/or diarrhea. There is slight cramping constantly in my lower abdomen and I constantly feel like I have to have a bowel movement but can only have whatever will come out after the intense cramping.  I am trying to stay as hydrated as possible, but not eating much as I'm not sure if it's more that I have loss of appetite or I'm just scared to eat anything. Also, I'm not sure if this is related or not, but I have been on my period now for about a week and a half which isn't typical; however my cycle is never regular due to Nexplanon - had it 2-1/2 years (Will be taken out by August). This makes it difficult to tell if any blood is from that or stool, so I cannot offer a confident answer on whether or not there is blood in the stool.","IBD , Crohn's Disease , Irritable Bowel Syndrome , Bloating"

I’m a cook though, love to concoct foods, so I thought about putting a mixture together that I could drink and wouldn’t be bad tasting and in one night, literally within an hour my stomach went down, I had a BM and within two days I went to the bathroom a few times, mind you I was backed up almost a week. No diarrhea or anything like that just a nice natural urge to go to the bathroom and cleaned out my system! I could not and still can not believe it!! My tummy is as flat as it has always been except for these months of horrid bloating!! I don’t have measurements of what I did yet exactly , I just make it the same twice a day everyday... but eyeing it out...about 1/4 cup to 2/3 of apple cider vinegar, about 1/4 to 2/3 water, I used the lemon juice that is in the plastic fake lemon that you get by the produce dept, I squeeze about 2 long squeezes of lemon juice into your vinegar/water mixture, then about 2 to 3 tablespoons of honey (depending how sweet you like it) then stir it up till the honey dissolves and all is mixed then add ice and drink up. I drink a small glass in the morning either before or after breakfast and then a small glass before or after dinner whichever would work for you. I’m telling you I SWEAR by this! My breakouts on my face went away, I have cleaned my digestive tract out, however you want to call that, it is absolutely amazing! I’m not a doctor or nurse so I cannot say this would work for everyone but at least give it a try! I was in tears the first night because I was very down on myself with my abdomen looking how it was and the sluggish physical and mental feeling I had.

I would say those symptoms have about 90% cleared up. However, I still have the red bump that appeared. It is going down, but I am still worried it could be an STD. I popped it, which I was unable to do before starting the antifungal, and no pus came out, just a little blood. I was tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea, and both of those came back negative. I did have oral sex about 5 weeks ago (I gave the oral). I did not see any sores on the other people. I also do not have any bumps in or around my mouth. The red bump appeared about 2 weeks after the original symptoms that have gone away due to the antifungal. The STD I am most worried about is syphilis because my red bump kind of match what is described on the internet. However, my bump does not look like an ulcer. (No raised edges, and a flat center). The bump isn't the size of an ulcer, it has gotten smaller with the antifungal. Also, I'd think if I had syphilis, I would have the more common STI's that I got tested for? I just don't know if the bump is a result of the bacteria that was treated by my fungal infection or a whole different thing altogether. Attached is a picture of the bump.

A few things went wrong: we used a condom but discovered that a bit of semen had seeped out the bottom and weren’t sure if any had made its way up, I had some mild diarrhea the day before and that morning (shortly after taking my birth control pill) which we read could affect the effectiveness of the pill, and I was on day 8 of my period (it had just ended 2 days prior) but found online that it was still possible to get pregnant at that point in the cycle. We didn’t want to take any chances, and thought better to be extra safe than sorry. 8 days later I got my period, which was 2 weeks early.

Sexual Health & STDs,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/sexual-health-stds/28502/secretly-intersex,Secretly intersex?,"Get ready, because this gets really TMI really quickly, but I'm at my wits' end and need some kind of help or advice. Okay, here we go: Let me start off by saying that I was identified female at birth, and was born with unambiguous female genitalia. My development was pretty unremarkable. As a child, I was a tomboy, but I also enjoyed typically ""feminine"" things like dolls and makeup. At age 14, I began puberty. I got my period and it was so regular, you could set your watch by it. However, other female characteristics which come with puberty did not happen for me, one primary example being the lack of breast development.  Then, by age 17, everything began to change. My periods became excruciating and irregular. I began growing facial hair. I sang in my school's choir (glee club, basically) and when I started my senior year, I sang as an alto. Halfway through the year, my range had dropped to tenor. Basically, in a sense, I had both a female and a penis-less male puberty. As I grew older and older, my facial hair became more prominent, my voice dropped to a lower and lower register, and now, at age 35, my periods are non-existent. I was very loosely diagnosed with PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome). I say ""loosely"" because no general practitioner or gynecologist has ever been able to find any significant cystic formations on my ovaries.  One thing my spouse noticed once, early on in our relationship, when we were having sex, is that my clitoris is located far lower than it should be. It is located more where it would be if it were a penis as opposed to a clitoris. So, I know you're wondering what my question is. I've seen documentaries and read a great deal of information about the different ways intersexuality reveals itself. One of these I've heard about is what is known as being ""chromosomally intersex"", where the individual potentially has unambiguous genitals, but they are intersex at the chromosome level, presenting with say, XY chromosomes, even though they appear outwardly to be female, or XX chromosomes though they appear to be male, or even XXY, and countless other variations. My question is this: Is there any possible way that I could be intersex at the chromosome level, even though it may not have manifested itself in an explicitly physical manner, such as having unambiguous genitals or internal testes, etc? Also, how would I go about finding out if this is really what's going on? Because I feel so utterly like neither sex (male nor female), I identify as ""gender non-conforming"", but I can't shake the feeling deep down in my soul that there's more to my physical sex. Please, I ask only respect from those who respond to my question. I have been through a great deal in regards to my physical sex and gender identity, and there are other variables as well. I am a nearly life-long sexual abuse/assault survivor, and I struggle with PTSD, as well as DID (dissociative identity disorder) because of it. Even this might subconsciously play into my gender identity issues, but I don't know. All that being said, if you are respectful and show empathy towards me, I will most certainly offer you the same. Thank you for taking the time to read this wall of text, and thank you, in advance, to those who offer me advice, support, and guidance in this matter. PS: Attached are two photos of what I look like at this very moment, to show the amount of facial hair growth I'm talking about.","Women's Issues , Men's Issues"

You know the old saying ""You are what you eat""? I understand it to be true, in a sense. If you eat fat, your body stores it. You eat protein to build muscles. Caffeine and alcohol effect your blood. My question is about swallowing semen. My girlfriend was a promiscuous lady. What happens to the semen and sperm of the past lovers she had? Did her body absorb it? Did any of the semen become part of her and her cells? She's particularly overweight, if that helps. Does that form a basis for more parts of the semen to be taken in and absorbed into fatty cells? What about the sperm cells themselves? Do they get passed out during urination or bowel movements? I know there are vitamins in semen, among other ""good"" things for the body (it's almost like the internet is TELLING girls to swallow and eat semen). How long do those things stay as part of one's body before being burned and renewed by another source (ie: In the sense of when you take your daily dose of B12 and you take more than you need, your body passes what you don't. But in a few days without B12 your body will take on more if you give it. What happened to all the B12 your body had in it?)?

I’m 28 years old and have recently had some issues with vaginal bleeding outside of my normal period. I’ve always had regular periods but in 2014 I started to bleed quite heavily and for a few weeks so I went to be seen. The dr performed a Pap smear and it came back abnormal. They told me to wait it out and do another in 6 months. 6 months later it was still abnormal so the next step was a colposcopy. I had that scheduled but soon found out I was pregnant. So they decided to wait until after the baby to do one if still needed. That Pap smear came back normal then a year later which was December of last year was normal as well. I’ve been on the same birth control pill for two years no issues. Last month I noticed some spotting after my normal period. It was pretty light and eventually subsided. I had missed a pill so I figured that was why. Now this month, my period ended on Sunday and my husband performed oral sex on me (sorry TMI) but I orgasmed and went to the restroom afterwards to find blood. It was fresh red blood. No pain or anything. So of course I was concerned. It eventually stopped within the hour. This morning my husband and I had actual intercourse, and again I found I was bleeding. Naturally I feel like the cervical dysplasia is back and I’m terrified I have cervical cancer. I have a drs appointment scheduled for tomorrow morning.

Over the past year or so, I've been experiencing an extremely rapid heart rate any time I exercise. When I say exercise, I don't mean heavy exercise at the gym, I simply mean when I'm outside running around with the kids, swimming, even going for a walk. It comes on very suddenly, it's not a gradual increase. My heart will go from what feels like normal to feeling like its pumping out of my chest. I can feel the heavy pulse in my neck as well. I've never felt anything like it. I have to stop what I'm doing and either bend over or inhale like I'm making myself burp (if that makes sense lol). This doesn't make it go away but it makes it more bareable. It lasts anywhere from 30 seconds to around 10 minutes. When it stops, it's a sudden stop and switch back to normal. I've tried cutting out coffee, that didn't do anything. I'm a nanny, and even the other day when I was rushing around and loading the kids into car seats, this happened and lasted more than 10 minutes. It ONLY happens when I'm exerting myself. It's never occurred when I'm just sitting or relaxing. I've avoided going to a doctor because they seem to link everything to anxiety, which I KNOW is not the problem here.

Lately I've been having some unsettling issues with my health. Months ago, I had an episode during which my heart rate shot up and my muscles seized. It lasted about an hour and my friends took me to the hospital, but it felt like hours of pain to me. It was excruciating. I was also extremely light headed, weak, and confused. My speech was slurred and I could hardly communicate or even move. I was told at the hospital I had Tachycardia, due to too much caffeine that day.  It happened again last week - same exact situation, except I was unable to go to the hospital. I hadn't had any caffeine that day.  There were splotches in my vision this time that wouldn't go away.  I also had a major migraine leading up to it this past time.  I have felt pressure in my chest for weeks now, it's the same feeling as if my stomach was full but it's where my heart is. I have also had a severe decrease of appetite.  I started to feel light headed about 7 months ago, but the episodes didn't start until January so I'm unsure what is related and what isn't. I am scared and uncomfortable and no doctor seems to have answers. I was told it was potassium deficiency, but my levels weren't very low - they said so themselves. I was told it was anxiety but I know that it's more, because it happens even on good days. My PCP did a blood test and said my levels were normal.  He said to cut down on caffeine and I have, still nothing has changed.  I'm currently on birth control (Lutera, 1 year) and Adderrall (2 years.)  I'm also a smoker, but I've been trying to cut down for obvious reasons, and the same with caffeine.

I took Pepto for a day or two and although it seemed to have eased the upset stomach, I still woke up the following day (Tuesday), same thing with diarrhea), but I did get to sleep 8 hours. I've continued to eat and drink crackers/7-Up, but when I wake up, I have a bit of stomach cramps, followed by me going to the bathroom and again, diarrhea.

It seems to be as soon as I wake up; instead of having regular daily stools, it's diarrhea.

I vomited until all the chicken was up. I thought this was just some weird stomach bug, food poisoning or something that was lingering after the flu. Next two days I ate a decent amount of food but no meat whatsoever and was fine. Then I went to get some food from a restaurant and decided on a grilled chicken breast. Same thing - severe vomiting and diarrhea. I went to my doctor for a medication review and told her about this and she thought it was weird, but just said it must be because of the flu. Couple more days pass - avoiding chicken, feeling fine. Then yesterday I had one of those Healthy Choice frozen meals with a small amount of white meat chicken in it. I was very shakey, nauseous (didn't throw up, thankfully) but I got really bad diarrhea that has lingered until today. Is it possible that I have become intolerant/allergic to chicken?

That said I don’t have as much pain as one would think. I do smoke which I am embarrassed to say and actively trying to quit. I also probably drink more than I should. Outside of the issues I am desperately seeking advice for I have been very depressed due to losing my job, family members with cancer, going through a divorce and so on. I am not seeking pitty I just want to do my best to give as detail as I can that may be a link to my issue.  I’ll start by trying to describe my day from the beginning.  I wake up every morning hacking and coughing very badly. There is often blood in the mucus I cough up.  Shortly after waking up I will begin hacking/choking so badly that I will vomit for a couple minutes and sometimes I’ll vomit again throughout the day. The vomit usually looks like a lot of phlegm (a lot) but at times is like green or yellow.  Throughout the day I cough and hack badly. When I cough there is often blood when I spit.  I get very nauseated a few times throughout the day. There are times during the day I feel light headed and almost like it’s slightly hard to breath. This seems like anxiety to me.  About 2 months ago I was having very bad migraines (which I have never experienced and was nothing short of horrible) that would wake me up every night for 4-6 months. Not sure if this could be linked. I haven’t had a migraine or headache for a few weeks until recently having bad headaches.  I apologize for any typos/poor grammar and the length of my post.

I'm a 22yo female and I've been having upper left stomach pain on and off for the past eighteen months. I have been hospitalised due to the pain becoming severe on two occasions.  Over the course of the 18 months it has been put down to gastritis five times, each time I have been prescribed either omeprazole or lansoprazole, medications traditionally used to treat stomach acid issues.  On my recent hospital admission I underwent a chest x-ray, ultrasound and endoscope - all of which came back clear and I was discharged with no diagnosis. Although gastritis, ulcers and acid based diseases were all ruled out. As were gallstones, liver/pancreas/kidney issues.  I am still experiencing mild pain every day in my upper left side and it has now shifted to my upper right as well. On physical examination, any pressure in the area directly below my ribs is uncomfortable and can be painful.  I've been referred on for a second endoscope, this time with a colonoscopy as well and biopsies will be taken at that time.

I'm new to the idea of joining online communities, but I'm game for anything that helps encourage and inspire others. A friend of mine actually suggested that I get out there (web) and tell my story. In July of 2017 I weighed 267 pounds. I had problems with brain fog, depression, asthma, vit D deficiency, GERD, and was diagnosed with IBS with inflammation. It was like I was waking up in the wrong body every day and trying to figure out how to get back to being me. My gastroenterologist recommended that I try the Low FODMAP diet and report back to her after 3 weeks to discuss possible solutions. During this elimination phase I completely dumped all Soy, Dairy, Wheat, Gluten, HFCS, Garlic, Onions, and Sugar Alcohols. This isn't a complete list, but these were the biggies! I didn't realize how addictive the substances were in the foods I was consuming or what they were doing to my body! For 3 weeks I went through food withdrawals, mood swings, and just felt like a total crazy lady! But, once my body detoxed from all that stuff, something amazing happened! I felt 10 years younger, had more energy, was able to reduce most of my meds, the brain fog was gone, and smaller meals filled me up faster. One of the things I learned was that HFCS is highly addictive and is designed to shut off your ""full switch"" in your brain. Now, my body's metabolism has reset! I've dropped down from a size 24 to size 14/15. I've dropped 58 lbs so far! Yesterday I weighed myself and was down to 209! My goal weight is 150. When I reach my goal weight I'm going to reward myself with a mommy make-over and full-body tuck, since my weight loss will be more than 100lbs. Last November, I plateaued around 40lbs of weight lost. That's when I discovered Arbonne! Arbonne's healthy living program has helped me lose 18 more pounds and continues to help me steadily lose 1 to 2 pounds every week! I drink meal replacement shakes for breakfast and lunch. My shakes taste amazing - are soy free, dairy free, Organic, Kosher, Vegan, and NonGMO certified. I loved them so much that I actually joined the company to help others experience the same life changing results that I had experienced, and to get the discount, lol! You guys, I don't care if you buy Arbonne from me or somebody else, but please! Do yourself a favor and try it! I guarantee you wi not be dissatisfied.

Digestive Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/digestive-health/52450/the-impact-of-innovations,The Impact of Innovations,"Innovative technology that impacts our everyday lives has been consistently and increasingly evolving. Americans have changed the way they operate day to day because of these recent technologies, like personal assistance on your smart phone or shopping for groceries online and having it delivered directly to your front step. Everything is connected to the use of technology and the health care industry is no exception. The health care industry has been moving slowly to adapt to changes due to the high risks and the magnitude of medical complexity, however, momentous changes are on there way.  	In healthcare, one of the greatest challenges is creating new and effective drugs. Billions of dollars are spent to conduct research and clinical trials to develop drugs that will benefit patients. The problem with these trials is the amount of animal testing that is used and the results that often fail to have the same effect on humans. To overcome these limitations, microchip modeling for clinical trials was introduced. According to Honigman (2013), “microchip modeling clinical trials aim to replace the use of animals in clinical trials to more accurately test the safety and efficacy of treatment for human patients and spare the lives of countless animals typically used in testing.” This technology helps to accurately test drugs for human use, by mimicking human organ functions. Organs depend on blood flow and bodily fluids to properly function. Organs also need movement, such as breathing or muscle contractions to operate. When testing on animals like a guinea pig, it will not have the same effect or function that it would have on the human body. Therefore, the microchip has three principles that will allow for more accurate results. “First, the establishment of a tissue-tissue interface where organ-specific cells and blood vessel lining cells come together. Second, the provision of fluid flow to mimic blood flow. And third, reconstitution of physiological mechanical motions, such as rhythmic expansion and contraction of the air sacs in our lungs or peristalsis in our intestines” (The Conversation, 2015). These elements create a technology were artificial organ function is mimicked on a chip to conduct clinical trials. The use of this technology will eliminate the need for animal testing and save billions of dollars on research trials.

It also listed these medications in her system at the time of death but all with very low amounts indicating that an overdose did not occur. Prozac and Depakot for bi-polar disorder. Benedryl for her allergies. Xanax obtained illegally. Oxycotin obtained illegally(we were told she was given half of a pill).

I'm an 18 year old female with no problems with my blood pressure what so ever. I'm rather healthy. Slightly over weight. I mean VERY slightly (It shouldn't affect my health at all). Maybe I should exercise more but I honestly am in a good enough shape (70kg). There shouldn't be any problems.  I do have a generalized anxiety disorder (with medication and all). I went to see a doctor because my anxiety got kind of out of hand and they wanted to do a more detailed blood test to rule out a few things (A routine thing) but when I went to check my test results online I noticed that my cholesterol was high. Like REALLY high. I do admit I like sugar but not enough to have it affect me this much. I was shocked. This is my first ever cholesterol check and I haven't spoken to a doctor yet but I am a medical student so I know how to read my results and as far as I know these aren't the results of a healthy young adult... My total cholesterol was 250 mg/dl.  My LDL cholesterol was 200 mg/dl. My HDL cholesterol was 45 mg/dl. My triglycerides was 145 mg/dl. (Normal) Now, I'm an 18 year old, semi healthy female with no known diseases (No diabetes etc), how come my cholesterol is all over the place?

Since then, I've had an itch on my penis and close to my happy trail, slight burn when I urinate, and what I think is nerve pain in my right leg which I only feel when I lay down.

I've been tested for HIV, Trich, Gonorrhea and Chlamydia which all came back negative. I've been to different doctors numerous times and they all suggest it isn't herpes and one has refused to even give me a blood test. I've also been prescribed Nystatin and Diflucan which don't seem to work. The itch isn't unbearable but its annoying and it's even more annoying that I still don't know what's causing these symptoms to happen for this long of a time.

Possibly something else? (Warning-long detailed post with a timeline of my symptoms),"I'm a 21 year old female and have had digestive issues my whole life which have gotten terrible in the last couple years. As a baby I had diarrhea and intestinal inflammation any time I was fed and they said it was just a dairy and soy allergy which I eventually grew out of..? I remember being a little kid 3-4 yrs old and suffering terrible constipation and pain with bowel movements. That too eventually went away and a few years later at age 7 I remember every day I had really bad intestinal pain and nausea (only occasionally vomiting) and I was so used to it I thought it was normal and never talked to my parents about it. I remember one day it just stopped. When I was at the end of my freshman year in high school I started to notice any time I ate, I'd have extreme abdominal pain, gas, bloating, and irregular stools. I usually went pretty often with soft stools but not much diarrhea..sometimes constipation. I had constant fatigue and brain fog. I had anemia symptoms even though they said my iron count was in range. I always was hungry and had a huge appetite so I ate good despite the fact that I would be in pain. My symptoms were so bad that it made functioning normally and going to school very hard for me. I also lost about 30 pounds in 3 months..no dieting, exercise, or anything. I had basic tests done and everything was normal. The doctor told me it was stress but I wasn't buying it. This continued for the next couple years and my weight would fluctuate between 110-125 (I'm about 5'5). I ended up dropping out of highschool and home schooling myself because my fatigue was so bad and energy was so low. School was very hard for me. I discovered certain foods would make my symptoms worse-wheat, grains, gluten, oats, dairy, soy, legumes, and some vegetables. So I was able to manage my symptoms a little better with dieting. My weight was up to 125. When I was 19 is when I started to notice soft black stools with dark blood mixed in and sometimes it was so much the water in the toilet would be blood red. I was going to the bathroom frequently and every time I did I felt a piercing pain in my abdomen. There was never a specific side or place of pain. This lasted for about a month or two and I dropped down to 99 lbs. i was so low on energy that it was very difficult to even get out of bed in the morning and I found myself passing out at times. I spent way too much time sleeping. The doctor ruled it out as stress (yes even the blood in my stool, even though I told him I have nothing to be stressed about other than my symptoms) saying ""almost every girl your age who suffers these symptoms either has stds or stressed over drama and boys"" which made me furious because it certainly was not the case for me. Fast forward to now - my weight stays around 110 which is still underweight for me. I suffer terrible fatigue and anemia symptoms. I mainly only eat foods that don't bother me as much such as white meat, fruits, and some cooked vegetables. I still go through spouts of diarrhea. I have constipation but with soft stools. There usually is maroon swirls and specks in it, black specks, a lot of mucus, and sometimes what looks like flesh. My stools are at times green, yellow, orange, or black but rarely ever brown. I have terrible abdominal pain. My bloating is so bad that I look pregnant and it hurts. I get extremely swollen. Sometimes I have acid reflux but rare. I have only learned how to naturally manage symptoms but it never goes away. My symptoms used to come only after eating which still is usually the case but at times it comes on randomly. It will last anywhere from a few days at a time to a few weeks. It's been making day to day functions and work very difficult for me. I'm waiting for my insurance to kick in to see a new doctor but I'm scared I'm going to get blown off again or not diagnosed properly.

I’ve done a little research, and what I gained was that LVH is basically a enlarged valve. I followed up and did a ultrasound of my heart, and everything came back as normal. A couple things worry me though. 1- my blood pressure sometimes spikes to 140/73. I know the bottom number is good, but the top number is not. However I am always extremely nervous when I take my blood pressure. 2- I am ALWAYS aware of my heartbeat it seems like, and I’m constantly checking my pulse. It’s the worse when I lay down on my back. I had a major panic attack back in feb 2017, where I felt like I was dying and I couldn’t catch my breath. I think it’s important to point out that I was taking adderall (prescribed not recreational) 20mg extended release during this time. And I was convinced to smoke some weed (I know, stupid) and that’s when the panic attack happened. It was horrible, and I’ve had major anxiety ever since. I had no chest pain during this attack, however my pulse was through the roof, my limbs and face were tingling and I couldn’t breathe. I did not pass out though. What I want to know is this. How can I treat this? I have not taken any adderall since that day, barely drank any alcohol, and I’m never touching weed again. But I need some help, it still feels like I have some underlying heart issue. By the way, I am a 24 year old male in great shape. Work out almost everyday. I use to be a competitive swimmer for 12+ years if that has anything tp do with it. My family has no history of heart disease, but my mom does have anxiety.

It felt like something was really wrong. I stood up and stretched my arms over my head and it kind of mitigated the pain a bit, which got me thinking it was muscular?

Later Wednesday night, after I ate my dinner (fish sticks, pierogies, macaroni and cheese and soda) i started getting a burning feeling in my throat, about 8:30-9:00 PM. Yesterday, the burning feeling was very bad, and woke me up early in the morning at 5:00 AM. I went back to sleep and it subsided for a little while but came back on and off. Today, its switched from burning to just pressure in my throat. I've been taking bismuth tablets and as of an hour ago Prilosec but nothing feels different.

When it happens, I get a little dizzy and start seeing dots in front of me. I also get chest and back of neck pain. Usually when this happens I sit down and breathe normally until it stops 10-15 minutes later. The problem is that it doesn't gradually decrease or increase into this state. It suddenly starts and suddenly stops. I asked my biology teacher about this and she told me that this is an adrenaline rush, and a doctor told me that it's normal for this to happen when I'm playing sports or anxious, but she doesn't understand that it SUDDENLY starts and stops. Could this be related to random moments when I'm casually doing something and my heart just skips a beat? This morning, this ""adrenaline rush"" happened for literally 4-5 beats and then stopped (or so I think, maybe I was dreaming). The only link I found with my heart skipping beats and adrenaline rushes happening is when I'm not breathing properly and when I'm getting tense. Could this be the cause? If not, should I check with a cardiologist about this problem? Also, is this dangerous? I'm 17 years of age (4 months to 18) and this has been happening to me occasionally for 2 years now. Not the heart skipping beats thing, the adrenaline rush while playing sports nervously. The heart skipping beats started recently.

I had bariatric surgery six years ago (vertical sleeve gastrectomy) where 80% of my stomach was removed. I lost a significant amount of weight and have maintained the loss well. Over the last year I’ve noticed a change; when I eat certain foods (i.e.; strawberries, raspberries, apples,) my belly would bloat significantly. So, I reduced these “trigger” foods and just went about my life. Now, for the last six months or so I’ve been having more and more bloating with every day foods I eat, except now it’s accompanied by upper and lower stomach pain. I wake up in the morning and my stomach feels fine and looks fine. By mid-morning after a normal breakfast I can feel the bloating begin and the pain starts. By the end of my work day my stomach feels so uncomfortable and distended, even though not much food was consumed. And the pain is worse by the end of the day. It’s not a horrible pain, but it’s present and it’s nagging. I thought perhaps GERD, so I started Prilosec (which is what I was on right after my VSG surgery.) But so far, I’ve not noticed an improvement. I’ve tried eliminating other foods thinking maybe it was something in particular I was eating, but it seems like anything I consume has this affect.

That didn't help anything. A few years later, I talked to a urologist. He looked at me and told me that I should be able to have sex 2-3 times a night multiple days a week because I was a health young man. He threatened to inject me with something to prove that my penis was okay. I passed on that. He also offered me some Viagra. Now let me point out again that during those 5 or so days, I feel like I'm God's gift to women and have no issues at all.   I recently talked to my primary care physician and he checked my Testosterone and it was on the lower end. He started giving me intramuscular injections of testosterone.

I don’t my partner’s STD status, so I’m concerned mostly about HIV risk here because I’ve read that pre-cum can contain amounts of HIV.

I'll start my saying that I'm a 29yo circumcised white male (healthy) Female (mid-40's, Hispanic, don't know anything else about her) I was in a really bad emotional state last week and just made a bad decision to see a sex worker. This was last Sunday (9 days ago). I was trying to be as safe as possible given the circumstances. For what it was worth, I asked her if she had any Std's or anything and she said that she didn't and always plays safe.  So I put a condom on and she performed oral for about 5 minutes, then we had vaginal intercourse for another 5 minutes. When I reinserted myself about two minutes into that and think the condom broke somewhere in there and may have had unprotected vaginal intercourse for possibly 3 minutes or so before we realized. Both of us were concerned and decided that we should just end it there since the mood was gone anyway. I asked again if she had any Std's for peace of mind and she said absolutely not and that she had a family and had to make sure she stayed safe. She says its not worth being unsafe (even though it's a very risky line of work she chose, etc). Starting the next day up to present (around 8 or 9 days), I've been experiencing a mild burning in my urethra and some tenderness/pain in my testicles. It doesn't really change when I urinate and feels like that feeling when you have really acidic urine or have to urinate really badly.

October 2018 got a scope done that showed gastritis and esophagus erosions the dr has given me 40 mg of protonix 2x a day. My symptoms are on and off some days very severe for instance today whole up felt nauseous ended up dry heaving and throwing up bile. The pills did work at one point recently seemed like they have stopped working. I recently had another scope done with bravo which measure your ph I have not got that test results back yet . I can barely eat and scared to eat because the heart burn gets so bad. My regular md did give me carafate to take which does help a little but I'm still dealing with these severe horrible symptoms I don't know what to do anymore !! I have totally changed my way of eating also since about August nothing greasy at all and I know all the foods to stay away from yet I'm still having trouble and no relief I'm looking for anyone who can try and help me get some relief I feel weak from not eating I can't function with this pain :(,GERD and Heartburn

I'm hoping someone out there has been through what I'm going through. After years of sever acid reflux to the point of aspirating it into my lungs at night and choking for hours at night. I also suffer from IBSD chronic head aches and joint pain. I had my first Nissen Fundoplication in October 2017, it worked! It was amazing! Then in April of 2018 I perforated by bowel and required major emergency surgery, leave a huge scar from chest to belly button. Instantly the acid reflux returned with a vengence. Back to the Surgeon I go begging for help, he did a gastroscopy and found that the entire Nissen had come undone :( I think my heart actually broke a little, the thought of what was to come scared me to death. The surgeon was scared to do another nissen due to the amount of possible scar tissue so he wanted me to try meds first. I already take pantaloc twice a day but now for some reason he added a medication call Restoran which is used for chronic constipation which I dont have. So now on day 6 of this med I'm in agony. I'm just waiting for the surgeon to call me and let me know what to do. I have a feeling I will require the very risky second Nissen. Anyone out there experience anything like this?

I was put on 40MG of Prilosec with moderate relief, but still had constant flareups. When I tell you I was absolutely miserable that is an understatement. It was not until I actually was referred to a natural product from my acupuncturist that I found 100% relief. Medi Herb HiPep M1335 actually controls the natural functioning of the esophagael sphincter. Without the sphincter muscle functioning there will always be acid relfuxing back into your esophagus from the stomach. Does not matter how strong the proton pump inhibitors are (that does not control the underlying issue, it just treats the symptoms). If the sphincter muscle does not close properly you will always have acid leaking back into your throat creating irritiation. Trust me when I tell you this, it provides “INSTANT RELIEF” I recently ran out of it, and my symptoms, came right back. I just started using it again, and it went away within hours.

The first sign/symptom was chest pain that I remember developing on New Years Eve. It was so bad that I wound up going to the ER the next day. The chest pain radiates all over the chest area to my back. I wound up going to the ER two times specifically for chest pain over the last month or so. X-rays, EKG's and bloodwork all came out fine and I was sent home.  It now feels like the exact center of my chest where the sternum is and right under it is very tender and not fun to press on. I went to the emergency room again yesterday for a new pain that was a stinging in my belly button area. It has been pretty constant for a few days now. I had a catscan with some sort of dye injection as well as a chest x ray and blood work. The ER doctor said everything was perfect in all diagnostic tests aside from a Diverticuli pocket he saw on the catscan but he said it wasn't infected or anything. What could this be? Would they have seen gallstones on the catscan with that dye? I had an h.pylori infection back in 2013 and it kind of felt like this but less intense. It was more so just heartburn. Could this be a recurrence? Do I have to get an endoscopy? I have severe anxiety over this and am in so much pain. I don't know who to go to. What will a gastro doctor do for this since a catscan and bloodwork was already taken? Do I have to get an endoscopy?","GERD and Heartburn , Bloating"

Like some of the most excruciating pain I’ve ever had. I’ve dealt with some pretty intense pain from a motorcycle accident I broke out over half my teeth, dislocated my jaw, ripped one of my thumbs almost completely off, broke a few bones, etc so I can deal with pain. I’ve talked to doctors and they say it’s gastritis or IBS or possibly even an ulcer. I don’t know. I should mention I am also on MAT (medicated assisted treatment) for opioid use. I take Subutex which has its own fun side effects. One being constipation. Anyway all this has a point I’m not just rambling on about myself. This new stomach pain makes me live almost 100% in a state of panic. Which in turn makes the stomach pain worse. I have dealt with acid reflux most of my adult life and take Prilosec daily.  I’ll try to describe it; it’s dead center under that dip in the sternum. It’s like a gnawing burning pain. It starts by feeling like I drank to much sweet alcohol or girly beer. And from there it will intensify to kind of a stabbing pain. Sometimes it will go away completely. Sometimes I can go a whole day without the pain. But that is rare. During the morning/afternoon it isn’t as bad it’s there but tolerable at night tho...that’s when it gets bad. It kind of feels like I am clenching my stomach muscle constantly. You know how you do when you tighten it up to see your abs lol. I’m a skinny dude so it not from me sucking in my gut. It drives me crazy. Sometimes if I lay down and relax and just chill to some meditation music and relax it seems to go away and it seems to get worse when I’m stressed. So I have no idea what to think. I feel like it could be an ulcer or ibs or a combination of things related to constipation and stress. Sometimes if I can pass gas or a bowel movement it helps the pain go away.  I don’t have insurance that’s why I haven’t been able to go to a doctor to have labs done yet. I’ve applied but in the mean time I just try my best to deal with it.","GERD and Heartburn , IBD , Crohn's Disease , Ulcers , Irritable Bowel Syndrome , Bloating , Ulcerative Colitis , Constipation"

About 2 months ago I had a protected sexual encounter. After withdrawing from the vagina I noticed the condom had come off and was still inside her. Shortly after (2 or 3 days) I experienced a fever, sore throat, and common cold or flu symptoms and some burning of the tongue, and general itching which I contributed to weather here. Also had some very dull testicle pain. No discharge or burning that I noticed. Some very minimal urethra irritation. Saw a Dr. and had urinalysis that showed “no growth”. Over the last week I have had swollen nodes in the neck, eyes are bloodshot more than usual, and very mild stomach pain. Then today over the course of a few hours I noticed a red spot on the head of my penis that hadn’t been there this morning. It is not raised or filled with any type of liquid.

I just wanted a springboard to help me to do all the common sense stuff I knew I needed to do- like exercise, shop well for the most nutrious foods.

I had some motivation & it was life changing. I could make plans! And show up! I made meals! Initiated phone calls, stayed up past 8:00 pm! However- the downside was my desire to do more- take better care of my kids, get a PT job, etc. Had so.much to catch up on. So I slept less- did more activity than was good for me; then I crashed.

However, there seems to be a small spot that doesn't go away, and if I sweat too much or stretch the skin somehow in that area, it often leads to a new hemmroid or another infection.

""Favor,"" ""cookie,"" and ""papa"" to name a few. Although this clicking is not particularly noticeable to others, it is indeed audible if they know to be listening for it or if we are in a quiet space. It is very audible to myself and, more importantly, very audible to a microphone. As an aspiring voice actor, this issue has caused me much consternation. I can't bring myself to submit auditions: the post production effort required to clean up my audio is excessive, much too excessive to expect clients to do for raw voice requests (which is the majority of what I can get from my agency). That's if the audio is even salvageable...sometimes the click falls on the very end of a word and it cant be edited out without damaging the word. I can't make the click not happen but I can control (to an extent) when it ""drops"" by keeping my soft palate in whatever position the the word I just spoke had it in, with the click then occurring when the palate relaxes. The click also occurs upon blowing air or upon release of puffing out my cheeks. A month or so after the clicking began, I developed an additional issue. My ears began to pop or crackle upon swallowing. This may have been spurred by sticking a cue tip too far in my ear, it may be unrelated. It occurs mostly in my right ear, sometimes my left, once in a while both ears. If its happening , its happening each time I swallow until it doesn't. It occurs more frequently if I've eaten dairy or something greasy. Sometimes I can stop the ear popping by hocking, flexing my soft palate, sucking back to clear my saliva from my palate or by whipping my head towards my shoulder. Occasionally my ears may softly ring for no more than 20 seconds. I saw a local ENT who performed a hearing test and measured the health of my ear drums. Tests show I have above average hearing and my eardrums seem to be in decent health with no perforations or fluid behind them. He shrugged and said he had no idea what was wrong and sent me to a neurotologist. The neurotologist inserted a long camera-type device and didn't see much out of the ordinary outside of my uvula flipping up when I swallow (this is not a noticeable sensation to me). He said my Eustachian tubes looked fine. He was able to visually correlate my theory that the clicking occurred upon relaxation of the soft palate. He did not know what the issue was but recommended I see an otolaryngologist and speech pathologist and that they consider a botox injection to my palate. This was a misguided recommendation on the line of thought I could be dealing with palatal myoclonus. My clicking is not the rhythmic, repeating clicking of PM, it is cause and effect: soft palate engagement -> relaxation-> click. The otolaryngologist and speech language pathologist quickly ruled out the botox idea, did the camera look, again correlated the click to the soft palate, and decided TMJ was very unlikely but still had no idea why my ears might be popping. They did notice the odd bubble forming close to my eustacian tube opening. We also found out that the click was much less likely occur if I had my head chin to my chest. They recommended I try to cut back on caffeine and try a nasal saline spray. I have had a hard time cutting back caffeine but I have tried saline nasal spray and steroid nasal spay to no effect. I have also tried Neilmed sinus rinse twice daily to no effect. I have also tried twice daily steam inhalation to no effect. I have searched online for other cases like mine and have found very little except the odd person crying out for help. I did find this forum thread from 9 years ago (that died about 2 years ago) with a bunch of people who were dealing with the same or similar problem.     In all that time that thread was going, only one person said it more or less went away and even then he couldn't say why accept that he dealt with it for three years, gave up on fixing it, and it just went away one day. One of the more depressing patters I've noticed from that thread and other isolated cries for help I've come across is that we keep going to professionals and everyone either inserts their own area of expertise so they can say they came up with a diagnosis or they just flatout admit they have no idea what's wrong. Information about me: - male, 26 - lost 47 lbs in the last 10 months and had lost around 15-20 lbs by the time the clicking began (weight loss connection?) - uvula flips up when I swallow - I did not have any recent ear, sinus or throat infections or other issues that precipitated the clicking/popping - Clicking from speaking feels like its coming from a right ""side"" for the most part. Can occur from a left feeling ""side"" when speaking occasionally. I've noticed that clicking from both ""sides"" can occur when I swallow, blow air or just engage my palate.

My history is as follows: Had Lasik (and a touch up a month later) 20 years ago and unfortunately was not able to get these records from that doctor since my records were long since destroyed. Currently posterior chamber intraocular lenses are both with mild central posterior capsular plaque, and I also have severe dry eyes. Everything else is OK. My doctor has recommended YAG laser to clear the plaques, and thinks that it may be the plaques that are causing my horrible post-op vision, but I am hesitant as I understand it may be difficult to change my IOL later on if I have the YAG laser treatment. I also wonder if the doctor maybe put in the wrong power lenses? Doctor has ‘concluded’ that I will need glasses/another Lasik procedure done to correct my vision rather than him trying to re-calculate the Toric placements or try a different lens and is trying to scare me with all the risks by going back into the operating room...blah..blah..blah. But why would I want glasses or Lasik when I have paid for the premium lenses? And how in the heck is it possible that my vision is still actually worse after surgery 2 months later? This makes no sense to me! I wonder if DMO doctors get into trouble (or get pressured) into not going back to the surgery room with patients (for costs)? I honestly am not looking for 20/20 vision correction, heck I would be happy with 20/30!   Below is a break down what my exams showed:   I had Acrysoft IQ torics put in both eyes with the power 18.5D/1.50CYL   Day 1, post-op exam for left eye: 20/25-2 with no pinhole test done at this time (At this time I was happy and thought that it was a successful surgery for being the day after for this eye) (pre-op was 20/40, no pinhole test done at this time either) 1 month post-op exam for left eye:  20/60-1 with pinhole at 20/25-1 (Yikes! What happened here?)     Day 1, post-op exam for right eye: 20/50 -1 (pre-op was 20/40 with pinhole at 20/30-2) Uh Oh, not nearly where I was with the left eye 1 day post op. 1 month post-op exam for right eye: 20/60 with pinhole at 20/30 (Ugh!)     My current manifest refraction: Right -1.00 (sphere) Cylinder -.075 Left -0.75 (sphere) Cylinder -.050   I am going to get a second opinion to see what a different doctor says before I try the YAG laser to clear up my plaques…..sigh…I’m just beyond broken here….any help or insight given is much appreciated!

For about 7 months now I have felt like there is something stuck in my throat. I am constantly clearing my throat, and when I do, the feeling goes away briefly, but returns minutes later. Some days are worse than others, but when I clear my throat there is definitely mucus in the back of it. It seems like post-nasal drip, BUT it gets worse with certain foods/drinks, such as caffeine, carbination. I have a history of acid reflux, and have been on and off antacids, but that has't helped the clogged throat at all.  I went to an ENT about 5 months ago. She did a nasal endoscopy and said everything looked fine (I had slightly excessive mucus, but nothing concerning). So she orginially thought it could be allergies. She gave me a prescription nasal spray and recommended coupling it with an over-the-counter saline spray and Allegra. I did that for about a month and didn't notice a significant difference. My throat still felt clogged nonstop.  *** I want to note that there is no pain, just EXTREME discomfort as I am feeling like a lump is in the back of my throat 24/7. So after the attempt at solving the problem with allergy medication did not work, she thought it might be the acid reflux creeping into my esophagus. She prescribed me Omerprazole, which I took for about a month or so, and still noticed no difference. The final measure I took with this ENT doctor, was a wallow scan. She sent me to a lab where I had an x-ray while I swallowed a liquid (apologies for the non-technical language). Essentially, this test would show what was happening when I swallow, i.e. is it going down and back up my throat, is it getting stuck somewhere, etc. The results came back and they said it was completely normal... stale mate. She then referred me to a gastroenterologist. He unfortunately was of no help. He basically said that this issue needs to be resolved by an ENT because the upper throat is not in ""his area."" He also said that the sensation I have in my throat may just be in my head. Not helpful and not true. He said I could take an antihistamine and that might help.  Anyway, I haven't been to another doctor yet, but I have scheduled an appointment with a new ENT next week. I just figured it would be worthwhile to post this and see if anyone has any insights or thoughts to share.

I have had many issues such as basic near-sightedness, astigmatisms, nystagmus, a lazy eye. All of it.  When I was about 5 years old, I had to occasionally wear an eye-patch to correct a lazy eye condition, so having crossed eyes are not foreign to me. For most of my life, this issue has not come up until two years ago (sophomore/junior year of high school). One of my eyes began to cross or drift inward towards my nose. My eyes have never been exactly straight, but now the issue has been gradually getting worse. To add to this issue, the eye that is off-center is never consistent. It always depends on which eye is dominant. If I'm favoring one eye, the other will be out of place and it is getting worse.  I have seen my eye doctor about this during a regular check-up and all he said was ""that's odd"" and he had no idea how to approach it and that it may be something neurological. I am about to enter my first year of college at Georgetown University and now I am really starting to get self-conscious about my eyes.

Eye Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/eye-health/59248/eye-surgery,Eye Surgery,"About 8 years ago, a friend received a free eye exam via a charity organization. The doctor indicated that the optic nerve was pale and there was something behind the eye and that MRIs of the brain and orbit wwo was required because brain tumor, stroke, etc. were likely. MRIs at that time were out of range; however, a 2nd doctor recommended blood tests to rule out Giant Cell Arteritis which was done and proved negative. Current day: Friend now has insurance. One eye is blind. The other apparently has a significant cataract. The doctor is now saying that the blindness MIGHT be glaucoma and that the 2nd eye may also have glaucoma but the diagnosis won't be known until the cataract is removed. MRI scans of the brain and orbit were done. According to the report, there is no inflammatory change in the orbital fat. Extraocular muscles are normal in caliber. Globes unremarkable. No prophosis. No orbital mas. No fluid collection. Cavernous sinuses enhance symmetrically. Optic nerves are normal in signal and morphology and do not enhance with contrast. Optic chiasm is intact. My friend fell and had untreated head trauma about 20 years ago. (Fell off ladder) They also had some type of reaction (allergy or perhaps infection) to dental work on the same side. The eye became inflamed with redness. Later x-rays at the time confirmed infection under the tooth. Of course years ago. High blood pressure is a factor. Medication started 2 weeks ago. Pressure is lower but fluctuates. During MRI when contract was added, a burning and slightly painful sensation was experienced on the side of the blindness. Emotional state is a roll-coaster. The electrical zapping feelings behind the ear on the blindness side are still there as is hearing the heartbeat. Also according to the report: partially empty sella, mega-cisterna magna and a tiny pineal cyst wo mass effect. So as I understand it, these are things of note which may be nothing but need to be noted. Moderate nonspecific signal abnormality within supratentorial white matter, basal ganglia, and pons. The radiologist suggests add'l correlation req. Possible toxic exposure to something like carbon monoxide.  Other items of possible note. Ticks are a constant battle and have been for 20 years Never tested for lyme disease. Took care of a person with severe shingles. Does not show any outward signs of infection. Experienced episodes of extremely vivid ""visions"" after a close family member death.  My question for now because the eye surgery is scheduled for the near future is:  Is a diagnosis of glaucoma consistent with the orbit MRI report? If not, could having the cataract surgery prior to figuring out why there's blindness in the bad eye be detrimental to the remaining ""good"" eye?  I'm inclined to get a 2nd opinion rather than jump in. My friend wants to have the surgery next week in order to save the remaining eye and hopefully get back some of their vision.","Cataracts , Vision Loss , Glaucoma"

Over two years there appeared to be no change in size. The fluttering/vibrating feeling was absent for several years but is now back.  In the interim (2015-2018) I have on occasion had excruciating facial pain that feels centered about 2 cm right of the bottom of my nose that feels like it is inside my skull and feels like someone stabbing me with an ice pick or something else. At times this is accompanied by pain in my right shoulder and to the right of my sternum. The pain near the sternum had me in the ER because ""chest pain"" in with my family history is very concerning. No cardiac issues have been identified and inclined stress tests with sonogram put me at low risk of heart attack. I am 1) curious to know how likely it is that the ear issue could be the result of the lipoma and if there is any chance that the facial pain could also be related and 2) wondering if I ought to return to ask about additional imaging given my belief that there is not much that could be done about a lipoma in the location described.

I got my IOP checked which was normal too, 14 Hgmm and 15 Hgmm. My question is, what could have been the reason of the large number of randomly placed relative scotomas?

Then soak your body in epsom salts and  apple cider vinager.This will kill the adults.Use a lice comb all over yourself to remove any eggs.If we find a lot of eggs we use peppermint oil mixed with water all over our bodies to kill the rest of them.All sheets are washed as soon as we get up.They are washd with peroxide and 20 mule team borax. All clothing we use every day is washed and also put thro the dryer ASAP.After several days you should feel better.The important thing in your arsenal is Raid roach and ant killer.This product is proven by case studies to kill them and does.For those of you having physical problems we were advised to take up to 5000 vit C. turmic cucumin several pills as well as Equate childrens allergy pills for the toxin from the bugs.This will make you feel better.We are horse people and totally get ivermectrin.We use the horse wormer as some of you are doing.I dose myself every six days with my weight on the tube.I do not feel by itself this is the answer but helps with some of the other things.I am very infected due to them going inside me.

It's a somewhat long read but I hope you read it... TL;DR: 9 years of 24/7 nasal congestion. 2 surgeries and years of various medical regimens have provided no relief. Problem: Nasal congestion 24/7/365. When it started: Around 9 years ago, I came down with a pretty bad cold. After the cold symptoms went away, the nasal congestion stayed.  After seeing an ENT specialist several times (around 2010), they believed the nasal congestion was caused by GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease) even though I have zero heartburn. They had me start taking Prilosec for for a few months and sleep with my bed on a slight incline so that the stomach acids could not flow into my throat due to gravity to see if this helped the symptoms. I was using Flonase as well. None of this made a change. Fast forward to about 2014 and I was still dealing with the same nasal congestion. I decided to start seeing an ENT again to see if I could get to the bottom of this. First I was put on a Sudafed/Flonase regimen for a few months. No change. Was put on a local raw honey regimen to see if it was allergies causing the congestion. No change (which I already knew was going to be the result because it started in MA where I was born and raised and I've lived in IL and now CA since).  I was referred to an Allergy specialist where they performed an allergy test where they poke the 40 something needles into your back to see what you react to. The only things I reacted to were a few types of grass that are not present in my current region or anywhere I have ever been.  Now I was finally referred to an ENT where my nasal passage was scoped a few times. It showed redness and inflammation in my turbinates but that's about it. We decided to move forward with a Turbinate Reduction surgery (2014) as well as a slight deviated septum correction. The deviated septum was very very minor and did not cause blockage but the doctor figured since we are already going in there we might as well take care of that as well. 6 months after the surgery, the congestion was slightly less but still there. Then eventually it went back to the way it was pre-surgery and the turbinates were inflammted still. I elected to move forward with another Turbinate Reduction surgery (2015) and understood this was pretty much the last time I could do this procedure as anymore reduction would start causing negative effects.  Fast forward to present day, OCT 2018, my nasal congestion is still present all day every single day. Throughout the years, I've used a Netipot, quit smoking, quit drinking, been put on Azelastine Hydrochloride spray. The only relieve I get is from a nasal decongestant like Afrin but I don't use it as it just makes it worst if I use it longer than a few days. I also get relieve when I'm using the Breathe Right nasal strips when I sleep.  It's honestly frustrating and I would really love to be able to breathe normally again.",Nasal Problems

Desperate For Answers.,"Good evening, I will try and be compact. In 2013, after a long period of emotional difficulty in which I used extended video gaming as a balm, I experienced an intense migraine. Ever since, I have not been able to look at a computer screen for more than 20mins - 2hrs without suffering the same visual attack. This has affected my life enormously and I have been unable to pursue most avenues of employment, especially those related to my skillset and education. The migraine begins with a feeling or soreness around the eyes. The veins on my head begin to pump. My eyes feel strained and then painful. It feels like they are trying to focus on something that isn’t there. This results in nausea, confusion and then escalates into a full-blown migraine, lasting on average 3 days. Under these circumstances working with a computer is out of the question. I am tormented by this and it has defined my experiences over the last half a decade to a horrifying degree. Here are the facts: I am male, 27. I wear glasses for close work (prescription correct), otherwise healthy. I had a squint in my right eye that was surgically corrected in Janruary. We were hoping that this would fix the issue but it unfortunately has not. These visual attacks occur only when I look at computer screens/laptop screens and sometimes under intense lighting (office lighting is often particularly bad) I have tried Migralens and various computer glasses to see if blocking out harmful light waves would help, but the symptoms remain the same. I work to adjust screen brightness/contrast/colour and my posture and environment, have used f.lux, but this only increases my buffer before a migraine by a small amount. I am unaffected by kindle screens, books, and other close work. Textured, colourful images such as computer games or videos are much more manageable than information. Reading and writing on the screen will result in a quick deterioration.  I am desperate. I have seen so many ophthalmologists and opticians who, whilst professional, simply are dumbfounded. Very few have any idea how to help or what to suggest and pass me along to the next department or person. This has been years of fruitless hospital visits. Whilst I am currently awaiting transfer back to a neurology department, I simply have lost faith that there will be a close enough investigation to get to the root cause of this. I must, must take control of my life again and this is my obstacle. If there is anyone at all who has lived with this and come out the other side, please get into contact and let me know that there’s light at the end of this miserable tunnel. I have never met anybody who suffers in the same way and it makes me feel insane. If I could somehow return to a normal 9-5 job with a computer, my life would change dramatically. I am not soliciting medical advice - I am asking for hope, for stories of people beating this awful thing. Because this - I can’t stand this. Thank you.",

Within 2 days of Restaisis my left eye opened very wide. My opthamologist erroneously suggested a neurological problem. I went to Emory University Hospital Opthamology for a second opinion and learned I have glaucoma in my left eye only, but they could not explain the receding eyelid, since my blood thyroid level is normal. Over the past 5 months, at Emory I saw four different opthamologists; general, glaucoma specialist, surgeon, neurologist. I've had several repeated eye and blood tests, a CT scan and a head MRI. All results are normal, except the pressure in my left eye indicating glaucoma. No one can explain the eyelid issue. All but the neurologist and I believe that the eyelid is not related to the glaucoma, however they all say that it is unusual fo to have either problem in one eye only and have never seen this before. The neurologist and I believe that it must be related, however, no one is offering any advice on treating the eyelid issue. Also, the glaucoma drops aren't bringing my pressure to normal after religiously and correctly using the drops for 5 months. I have a follow up visit with the glaucoma specialist on Tuesday 4/17.  Has anyone ever seen or heard of this situation I describe, and if so, was there any resolution to it.

I figured I'd try again.  Every once in a while I get this horrible, excruciating pain in the external, left ear, on the area that's labeled ""concha"", if you look at a picture of outer ear anatomy. It started over a year ago and it comes so randomly. I want to a ER/walking clinic once while I was experiencing the pain. They prescribed me antibiotics in which I never took because the pain suddenly dissappeared, as suddenly as it came on! That's what happens. It will come on suddenly and then just stop as if a switch was flipped, an hour or so later.  Nothing really alleviates the pain. Not even Advil. Every so often I am able to tug or press on the area and I'll ear a pop (an external pop, not the kind you hear when you swallow). It sounds like when you crack a knuckle, and then the pain will suddenly go away. That doesn't always work though and so sometimes it last a few hours and then just disappear. When the pain is there it's horrible. It's achey and sometimes shooting. I can't turn my head or I'll geta really sharp pain. Forget touching that part of my ear, it's so tender. Sometimes my ear will feel hot and get red on the rim of my cartilage. It's really painful.  Ive been examined before while the pain was going on and they saw nothing unusual. I always ask my husband to look at my ear when it's happening, and he sees nothing. I went to see an endocrinologist who tested me for several autoimmune disorders and he ruled out Relapsing polychondritis (which seems to be the only disorder that matches my symptoms).  It's so frustrating because when I'm having an episode it hurts so bad, I feel like I cannot function and I get really touchy and agitated. Every doctor tells you to come when you're having it but even though I've been logging my episodes, I cannot predict when I'm going to have one! It just happens like turning on a switch, in the middle of the day, and it goes away that same way.  Weirdly enough too I've notice that I get it a lot more during the week before my period.  I've narrowed it down to three possible causes after I've been actively logging episodes.  1) I have mild psoriasis on my scalp. Recently I noticed very small patch of it behind my right ear, right in the fold, where your ear adjoins to your neck. I have read that you can gerbil psoriasis actually inside your ear canal. I wonder if that's what it is and maybe it effects a nerve that goes to my outer ear. Sometimes I pour peroxide in my ear during an episode and the pain dissappears. I also apply a steroid cream to the painful area.  2) the other culprit is my headphones but this one I'm not to sure of. I often fall asleep with headphones in my left ear. They are the earbud type that come with iPhones. I know you shouldn't do that, but it happens. while I believe it can be them, I wonder why I don't get the pain every time I fall asleep like that. I will only get it 1-2 times out of every ten times I fall asleep with them in.  I know other people out there are experiencing this too!

I mentioned it to the nurse, and she said she would tell the doctor, but he never said anything about it. I have had several eye exams the last 5 years, and it has never happened before.

I think I just feel like talking and getting it out. If anyone would like to respond, though, it would be most appreciated! Four years ago, I had a retinal detachment in my left eye that was successfully treated through surgery. Thing were going along fine, eye-wise, until last year when my optometrist diagnosed me with high eye pressure, which is a risk factor for glaucoma (which runs a bit on my mom's side of the family). Anyway, I received laser treatment in April 2017 (also on my left eye) to lower the pressure -- it actually worked so well that the pressure was decreased in both eyes, something that's not all that unusual. Anyway, fast forward to a couple weeks ago. I'm not sure how I discovered it, but i noticed that the vision in my left eye was really blurry. I had no other symptoms, but got my glaucoma specialist routine appointment moved up a few days and she super-dilated my eyes and did all kinds of tests, noting that not much ad changed from our last visit (retina and optic nerve looked fine, etc.) and that I had a cataract in my left eye (and a lesser one in my right), something that we already know. She seemed to think that that's what the trouble was. Honestly, my vision has seemed to be going downhill slowly since the laser treatment, especially when I would wear my contacts and i was expecting a prescription change at my next optometrist appointment. SO, since then, I have been experiencing symptoms that I've attributed to a possible brain tumor-- but, as I've been told, could also be anxiety. I'd like to point out, that I don't really suffer from health anxiety in general, but when something goes wrong, it seems to kick in. Last January (due to stress I think) I had a headache for a month and was convinced it was a brain tumor. My PCP prescribed supplements, etc., and the headaches eventually went away. But for the last week or so I've been headachy (nothing too bad), occasionally nauseous with a really gurgly stomach, my ears are really ringing, I feel generally blah (better in the AM, worse as the day goes on), when I wake up during the night, my hands are usually asleep (something that's been going on for a while, actually). I don't think these things would bother me as much if I hadn't experienced the somewhat sudden vision change in my one eye. Put together, these symptoms seem to point to a brain tumor. The only think keeping me sane is the knowledge that this is the eye I've had trouble with in the past and it would make some kind of sense if something went wrong there again. But part of me thinks that since I started worrying about it, that's what started these odd symptoms. Part of me also thinks that I just have some kind of low-grade bug that's hanging on. I don't know. I just know that if it doesn't start improving, I'm going to go insane and grown further convinced that something is really wrong. My appointment with my retina doctor, my glaucoma doctor and the cataract surgeon aren't until the end of this month! What does everyone think? Thank you for listening.

It calmed down about as quickly as it sprung up, but the feeling of fullness and tone remained until the next day. Two days after my left ear had that experience, the same thing happened to my right ear, where I had a very uncomfortable feeling of fullness and loud tone in my ear. Over the next few hours it calmed down, again, and by the next morning it was barely noticeable.  I have no idea what exactly I experienced, but I can say that I've been having a ringing noise in my ear for the past two months or so. I saw an ENT about it, and they said that I must've had genetic hearing loss or something along those lines. I didn't experience anything like what I described above before my appointment.  I've since scheduled an appointment at another ENT for September 14th (the earliest they could get me in, apparently), but I'm still concerned and was hoping I could have some insight as to what's going on. Right now, my hearing seems fine...? I can understand my family much better than I could when the fullness feeling was happening, and I don't think my hearing is really any worse than what it was when I visited the ENT, but it's hard to say.",Ear Problems

I waited two weeks to see my family doctor, who told me if it didn't improve in another two weeks to contact an ENT. I did that, and had to wait an additional three weeks for the appointment to roll around, which happened two days ago, actually. A nurse conducted a hearing test, took my ear pressure, and the doctor looked at my ear drum. Nothing seemed off (apart from the hearing loss in the upper registers), so they told me I had some sort of genetic hearing loss going on and I had to just wait and hope things didn't get worse. I rescheduled for three months later, late November. Yesterday, I was sitting in lecture when I had a very brief, sharp pain in my left ear, accompanied by a bothersome feeling of fullness/pressure and a *very* loud roaring noise in my ear, similar to what it sounds like when you open the window on the high way. The roaring calmed down by the time I got home, but the feeling of fullness remains, and I can still kind of hear the noise right now in addition to the normal ringing, the next morning. I do also get infrequent, dull pains, but these aren't too bothersome. My question is if this is normal to experience with hearing loss. I'm only 21 and haven't been exposed to any loud noise prior to all this, I've been deliberately been avoiding headphones when possible and music in general for the past 2 months, so I wouldn't think that this is something I caused.

Eye Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/eye-health/41992/intense-chronic-pressure-behind-right-eye,"Intense, chronic pressure behind right eye","Hello all. As I wait for insurance to come through before I go back to the doctor, I’d like to open this up to the knowledge of the masses. I’ll try to keep this long story as short as possible. My symptoms are as follows: For at least the past four years, I’ve been experiencing an intense concentrated pressure in my right temple behind my right eye. It’s chronic, altering between quite intense to rather mild, and it often spreads to the rest of my head, face, and neck. It almost feels as if some huge wrestler like Andre the Giant had his hand on my head and is squeezing, with his thumb on my right temple providing the most pressure there. I can feel a kind of twisting of the nerves in the pressure, as if there is something is alive in there, an unsettling thought. If I’m working or generally keeping myself busy, then I barely notice the pressure. However, if I’m still, for example during meditation, when I’m watching a movie, or lying in bed at night, it’s very potent. I wouldn’t describe it as painful, just very intense, and it’s there pretty much all the time. However, once every three weeks or so, it does get strong enough that it actually becomes quite painful. Generally speaking, the pressure is more intense at night. This pressure has also affected the vision in my right eye which has decreased significantly over the past couple of years and is often blurry. Oddly, when the pressure is strong, massaging the temple or even simple touching it makes it go away almost instantly, only to return in full force when I remove my hand. There is no bulging or anything unusual I can feel on the temple - from the outside, it seems normal. Last year, I had a brain MRI scan which did not show any obvious problems. My doctor believed it was due to anxiety and prescribed medication which did seem to reduce the pressure initially, but only about 25% or so, and it has since returned in full force even with the meds. My eye doctor has also told me that there is nothing wrong with my right eye (having only checked with equipment in his office). In my online research of this problem, I’ve seen many postings of similar symptoms, but never any that matched entirely. The possible causes also do not seem to match completely. Migraines, cluster headaches, and a sinus infection have been ruled out by my doctor. The MRI I suppose (and certainly hope) means that a tumor is probably not the cause (knock on wood). I assume glaucoma is out after my eye doctor gave my right eye a clean bill of health. A primary suspect, anxiety, is something that I live with daily but it does not stop me from living a normal life. Tension headaches are possible, but I have a hard time believing they could be chronic and could manifest themselves so specifically to such a small area. And even during times when the rest of me feels quite relaxed, the pressure remains, which leads me to believe that it is independent of the anxiety, that there’s something wrong behind my eye. Even when I was recently in a luxurious hotspring and my body had rarely felt so relaxed, the pressure raged as strong as ever. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Is it possible they missed anything with the MRI? Do brain MRI scans cover the eyes as well? Could anxiety really manifest itself so strongly? Is it possible that eyestrain from working with computers over the past 15 years could be the culprit?  Thanks a lot for your time.",

Approximately 4 days ago I was exposed to a very loud fire alarm in a small corridor. After the fire alarm went off, my ears were hurting a bit but everything went back to normal. I came home a few hours later and fell asleep on the the couch. When I woke up I noticed my tinnitus was way louder than usual, I was dizzy, all sound has became sensitive to my ears, have nausea, diarrhea, hot and cold flashes, and my ears feel like I have an ache in them. (my ear felt like fluid was inside causing an ear ache) I searched online for answers to see if I was coming down with something, as multiple people at work were getting sick. To no avail, I found nothing useful of what I was going through as all my symptoms carried over to too many multiple diagnoses. 4 days after all of this I went to an urgent care to get seen because nothing is changing and sometimes I feel like my symptoms are getting worse. The doctor told me that I have some liquid behind my ear and my throat is slightly swollen. Prior to this I told him last week I had a sore throat, (which I assumed was strep throat), and like I always do I take over the counter medicine and wait it out. Unfortunately my throat has been swollen with no pain for the whole time leading up to the other incident and symptoms. The doctor said that the tube that goes from my throat to my ears are filled with the liquid from a sinus infection and they will clear in time as my infection leaves my body. He said this is causing my middle ear to be muffled inside, even if it doesn't sound like it, and it's causing my ears to be sensitive to noise which is making my tinnitus sound like it's more potent then normal.  I was advised to take 3 ibuprofen every 6 hours until swelling in my throat dissipate's and if nothing changes within 3 days to come back for further evaluation. Also the nurse that took my vitals said my temperature and blood pressure are normal but she's seen more people this past week for sinus infection than usual due to the weather and allergies. Where I'm getting at through my whole story is if there's anything I can do to help sooth my tinnitus sound until this all clears up. I'm used to my tinnitus and have lived with it for so long that it's part of my normal life, but with the sound becoming more distinguished and potent, it's driving me a little bit insane. My hope is that the case of my tinnitus being so loud is due to the liquid and muffled ears, because when I muffle my ears with my hands the ringing sounds normal like it used to. However when I un-muffle my ears the sound isn't like it used to be prior to all of this. It's very hard to even fall asleep right now even with a background white noise due to this situation. I used to be able to fall asleep by just focusing in on a fan or music but now the ringing is over masking all of this, which would make sense if my ears are being muffled. Questions: 1. What will help clear a sinus infection? (viral bacterial infection as I believe the doctor called it) 2. Is there hope the tinnitus will dissipate? 3. What other helpful insight is there on background noise to help sooth the ringing while I sleep?","Ear Problems , Cold , Throat Problems"

I have gone to specialists but all of their treatments seem to only relieve me temporarily. After trying every over the counter medication available, I have been put on antibiotics in the beginning of this illness, then was given prednisone twice. I was also told to do sinus rinses with budesonide which doesn't seem to be doing anything anymore.  My only relief is hot showers and medicated nasal spray.

It seems to get worse when I drink milk and ice cream, which lead my boyfriend into thinking I have a dairy allergy. However, I don't feel any worse when consuming other dairy products. I still cut out dairy and nothing changed. It just gets worse with dairy, so I cannot explain that. I'm worried that my only other option will be surgery, as all the treatments that I have had so far seems to do nothing. A new symptom has popped up, popping and itchy on the inside bit of my ears. I have had a CT scan and there has been no signs of deviated septums or polyps. All they say is that I am severely inflamed.  Has anyone else experienced these issues, or know someone who has a similar story to mine? Any idea on what the cause could be?

The color doesn't shift all at once. The movement of the color is almost like if someone dumped out a big bucket of paint, then the paint spreads out to cover the floor. It's as though the color is rushing in from all directions, starting at the edges and finishing in the center. Or sometimes it moves into my view from just one side, like right-to-left. The timing of the color shifts does not seem to correspond with my pulse or respiration. The color washes in, stays put for about 2-3 seconds, then the next color washes in.

On April I started having heart palpitations randomly so I went to the ER, general doctor there asked for an ECG which come back normal so he prescribed me Xanax 0,5mg/ once a day for 5 days, after 10 days the palpitations stoped. Couple of weeks later they come back this time I also got Ill with zebra I think was a bad cold, I had fever of 38, headaches and mucus. I noticed it took me a long time recovering from that cold. When I got better 2 weeks after since I was still having palpitations I went to the cardiologist. He listened to my heart and told I had a heart murmur I/II degree, did a 24 hour Holter and found I was having tachycardia, and sinusal breathing arritmia. The Dr said it was nothing serious so prescribed nothing. Meanwhile I had lost 5kg in a month ( probably because of the cold). Had an investigation of what was causing the heart murmur so I did:  Thyroid eco: found several cistes on thyroid  Heart eco- all normal and functioning normal no alterations  Thyroid hormones tested- TSH, T3 and T4 all within normal range  Blood work- all normal  Nose and throat bacteria test- found a Kleibsiela bacteria on my throat (antibiotics prescribed for that) nose come back clear.  During that time I started experiencing sometimes pain on my left arm ( I thought I would have a heart attack) but it went away  I had electric shock like sensation down my right arm or shoulder sometimes but it would last miliseconds (that also stopped)  I experienced sometimes at night my temperature raising and a little bit of sweating (really minimal sometimes just between my breasts a bit)  I still have excessive hair loss and recently had to have my hair cut short (but I also been trying a new hair relaxer and dye it might be it. I just never had so much hair loss before)  I noticed jerk like movements when I'm about to fall asleep at the first it happen 3 times now I have muscle spasms constantly they are very small and last miliseconds too  My heart had no reason to be having arritmia so I was sent to the endocrinologist.  Showed all my lad work and was sent to have anti- thyroid anti-corps tested.  It takes two weeks for me to get the results so I have to wait.  Since this first started I have eye discomfort but for the past 3 days I sometimes had something ""flow"" on my peripheral vision but bothers me. It's like I can catch any movement or light and it is just a weird perception and I see even small particles floating on the air.  Summing up my symptoms are:  1- heart murmur I-II and palpitations ( tachycardia and sinus breathing arritmia)  2- hair loss (brittle very thin hair)  3- eye discomfort and weird vision  4- neck stiffness and neck pain  5- neck lymph nodes enlarged and thyroid nodules  6- weight loss and apetite loss 7- increase on bowel movements  8- menstrual cycle alterations  9- jerky involuntary movements and muscle spasms  If anybody has any idea what this can be or what other tests I should do please help me out.

Without going into details, Sandy has no health insurance & it's been difficult to get the help I'm sure she needs. So, she went to the County Health Dept & was told to go to a hospital emergency room. The referred her to an eye doctor. She went to the eye doctor & was told ""you're out of my league"" & they referred her to a specialist. The specialist wasn't quite sure what it was, but suspected it was some kind of bacterial or viral infection. He prescribed some drops & meds, to no avail. It was then recommended that Sandy have surgery so they can get a sample of eye fluid & run tests to determine the exact cause of her condition. Since the beginning, Sandy has slowly been losing sight in that eye & it's only getting worse. The County Health Dept has refused to approve a referral to get the necessary surgery. They told her it was probably cataracts & as you get older, ""everybody gets them""! Sandy is in the lengthy process of trying to get some form of aid, but time is of essence & I fear she'll go totally blind in that eye if left untreated for much longer. The doctors she has already been to have suggested that it's possible that, whatever it is in her left eye could spread to her right eye. That would be horrible! I would be very appreciative if anyone out there can provide ANY insight, info or suggestions about this matter. Any ideas as to getting medical assistance is also appreciated.

I feel like we can't hang out with other kids anymore, with out her getting strep like 5 days after. And when she's sick we don't go around them until the Dr looks at her and says she's well. So now, she's terrified and TOTALLY NOT used to kids her age, and only likes older kids & adults. I buy toys that are easy to disinfect (except those darn Legos ). We don't get to go to church about 50% of the time, or birthday parties etc. I have friends who's siblings or children have had cancer/transplants/other immunity suppressing diseases that we just can never be around. I'm worried for her health, the antibiotics, and the stress this brings to her and our family. Any input welcome and appreciated.  She's completely vaccinated. she has no other signs of autism, so we don't think that's why she has problems with other kiddos. But opinions and advice on helping her play with others the few times we get to are welcome as well. Please help! I really want for her to be healthy and happy!",Throat Problems

Please help me.,"This will be a long post so i apologize, but i need opinions.  Ill start with this. I have ulcerative colitis and have previously taken asacol on and off. If i dont take meds, the ulcers in my intestines can lead to colon cancer. (How my doctor puts it) I am 22.  Anyway here it goes. About 2 years ago I made a stupid mistake to sleep with a guy a barley knew. We hungout for about a week and at that time he had a red eye, he claimed he scratched it, and eventually got antibiotic drops. We stopped seeing each other shortly after so idk what happened to him overall. About a week or so later I ended up waking up with a red eye thinking it was just irritated I put my contacts in. The next day I had two red eyes. I then went to my doctor who prescribed me drops and pill form antibiotics. Cant recall if i completely finished the drops but I remember thinking that they wernt helping. I was in pain and my eyes were swollen and red. I was told it would go away in a few days and was givin some over the counter pink eye drops redness drops which burned so bad i stopped using them. At this point i think u had been suffering over a week or so. I could not bare the pain anymore and was desperate, so i found some home remedies for pink eye. I found that deluded lemon juice or deluded apple cyder vinegar helped to fight pink eye, so i tried it. ( probably huge mistake) this didn't work but I do wonder if this caused some of the issues I had. Things got so bad I ended up going to the hospital where they found a few spots on my cornea (I was having light sensitivity) and prescribed me with steroid drops. I think at that time they diagnosed me with EKC.  Things after though never got better. I ended up developing true membranes (ones that bleed when cut) in the lower and upper part of my eye.  I went home that night and read something about putting green tea bags on eyes to help inflammation so I gave that a try. The next morning I woke up and coule not see. Everything was blurry and every light had a halo around it. (This eventually subsided as the day went on but vision was still blurry) but in a panic, i was yet again taken to the hospital.  I got there and the doctor flipped over my eye lid to look and it just started bleeding. At this point nobody knew what was going on. i was referred to a surgeon. I did forget to mention I was tested for trachoma and I think ghonorea ( im not sure) and both came back negative. When I got the the surgeon I was then prescribed more steroids and a heavy antibiotic drop to take for a couple weeks when things finally started to clear up.  I now have symblepheron in both eyes where membranes were, dry eyes. I also have a blocked tear duct in right eye. The surgeon diagnosed me with Stevens Johnson's syndrome due to taking previously asacol and the sulfa in it. (Although this is not a sulfa drug)  I need help. Because of this diagnosis I have been suffering with my ulcerative colitis and am limited in medications i can take. Currently on steroids now.

Anyway, after getting off online, I needed to help with the chores because one of us at home is sick in the hospital. The thing is I am already tired from my computer use, but I still have to force myself to wash the dishes by hand, attend to the dog, and cook dinner. I did this for the whole week. Anyway, after that week, I noticed that my dizziness (the light-headed-ness sort and not the world-is-turning-around kind), won't leave even if I stop using computer for a long amount of time. I have noticed that whenever I strain my eyes (read a book, watch TV, computer use, but especially computer use), this light-headed-ness intensifies. And this is with me until the next day. Lately though I've noticed that my recovery time have improved, but the dizziness is still there. I have already visited the doctor twice. Took the prescribed anti-vertigo pills for three days, changed the prescription of my glasses, and had my blood tested. My blood content is normal, my BP normal, my heart and breathing okay, I don't know what's wrong with me. I hope I get well soon. I can't forever avoid computers, since they are a necessity. And I'm not saying that because I'm fond of the internet. School and jobs rely on the internet after all. Please help. Thank you. Update: Light-headed-ness is 24/7 though it doesn't bother me much while on the computer. It's more felt while I'm walking or moving. Feels like I'm floating somehow, almost camera-fish-eye feel but not quite.",

I am now 32 and had some ear pressure/hearing problems after flying. I went to the ENT and had a hearing test done and it was within “normal range.” About a week later I had a follow up with the ENT doctor. His nurse came in and asked if I wanted tubes put in. I told her no. She left and came back and said he wanted to look at my ears under a microscope. Once I was laying down thinking he was just going to look at my ears he proceeded to numb my ear and put a tube in!!! I am appalled by this and now I can’t hear anything. He told me to “call in a week and if I hate it he will remove it?” I don’t know what to do and there is no information online about this. I am scared I am going to have further hearing damage.

She was unsteady on her feet an felt like her head was spinning and she vomited. She was diagnosed with labrynthitis. She was completely in bed for 2 weeks. Slowly was able to go back to work with physical therapy, but she is always a little dizzy. Has dizziness when moving her head a certain way, with bearing down, and just in general, the physical therapist told her she thought that she also have positional vertigo that she got either at the same time as labrynthitis or after, she has done a few treatments of the eply menuever with the PT. It seemed to be at a plateau for a while with nothing worse or better. Then this weekend she had a stressful couple of days and woke up dizzy again, more dizzy then usual. She went to work for a few hours and then had to come home because the dizziness was getting so intense. She came home and lay down, laying down quickly caused her to vomit. She rested the whole day and woke up feeling better but still more dizzy then usual. My question is this: is this normal? She got an MRI and it came up clear but I am worried they missed something, should she get another? Do others have this experience? I am very worried.",

How much did you folks research your surgeon and how much did you research prior to the surgery? I am sorry you are having problems. This is your vision folks. I have had both eyes done one for the interior lense on the left eye in 2010 without anesthesia a local only and watched the procedure. Then in 2012 I had lense done on my right eye with a twilight anesthesia. I will never have it done that way and it was done after I specifically told them no. That being said I have not had to wear glasses since my surgeries and I was a long term glasses wearer from the fifth grade. Also I am 65 years old. I researched and asked questions of both surgeons. I lost insurance between surgeries and could not go back to the first one so have had two major hospitals doing the surgery. Run do not walk to your surgeon and ask all the questions you have. Do not expect your doctor to anticipate or know what is going on with you. That is your job to explain in detail your symptoms or concerns. If you are not being informed to your satisfaction go to another surgeon with you file in hand. Keep asking until you get a satisfactory explanation. Your are your best and most knowledgeable advocate. It is up to you. If you do not feel comfortable asking the questions have some one go with you to advocate for you. There is never a stupid question regarding your health and you deserve a doctor that understands that  I wish you the best.,Cataracts

A couple of weeks after the surgery she began to experience vertigo and eye pain behind her eye, on the same side of her face as the surgery. The pain is worse when she lies on the left side (surgery side). She took two antibiotics and a steroid post-surgery to rule out or prevent infection. She has been to primary care twice, the oral surgeon twice (he says it's not related to the surgery), an ENT twice, ophthalmologist, and is doing vestibular therapy with a PT. She also had an MRI (without contrast) that came back normal. Our next step is an appointment this week with a neuro ophthalmologist, but so far no one has answers.

Eye Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/eye-health/28677/drifting-vision,Drifting vision?,"So I want to give a back story along with other things that are occurring. I'll begin with the very beginning I started a job as a Meat clerk at a grocery store. I would just put meat into the cases and clean the saw room where everything was cut. After a few months on this job I developed a really bad eye twitch in the skin of the lower part of my eyelid, this was only happening on my right eye. It eventually progressed where when I tried to focus with that eye whatever I was focusing on was moving left and right very fast. Then I lost the ability to move the top half of my lip on the right side. I also was breaking out in cold sores maybe every other week at this time. I went to the doctor and they said the twitch and breakouts were stress, the lip was bellspalsy and put me on acyclovir after a week I had regained control and the twitching stopped as well as the breakouts. I went months symptom free and now I have this going on. I started a job where I was standing stationary on a mat and just matching work gloves together and wrapping them in bundles to be cleaned. My first day on this job caused my a lot of neck pain and soreness in the legs and lower back. I ended that day and went home and took some ibuprofen and ate protein hoping to heal what I worked so i'd be ready for the next day. I started the next days shift and 1-2 hours in the pain became unreal in my neck so I took another dose of ibuprofen. I lasted another hour while the pain was getting worse to the point of anxiety and uncomfortably just trying to do the job. It got so bad I had to sit down in the restroom and I remember almost throwing up as well. I explained to my boss what was going on and asked If I could leave for the day, he said that was fine. I punched out and on the walk to my car It felt like everything was moving and I remember just walking and randomly falling to the right. The actual drive home was even worse, it felt I was looking at the rode with my head tilted and my head wasn't tilted. I had gotten a call shortly after and was relieved from the job. So I've been trying figure out whats going on. I went to a chiropractor for an adjustment and explained to him what happened. They took xrays of my neck and said the top of my spine was curving. He had me do a test where he wanted me to keep my right arm elevated in front of me at a certain height and with my eyes closed lift the left arm to the same height, I did what I thought was the same level and the left one was about a hand length lower than the right. He wanted to look at my legs as well because of my balance and after putting my legs together he said my right leg was 3/4 of an inch out of place. He did some adjustments in my legs and neck which helped things a lot. The tilted vision got better but now I have something else going on. I'm walking really goofy, a friend described it as stiff leg or drunk walk. My vision is fine looking at something straight ahead until it gets far then my vision wants to look down. I lay in bed watching tv from the side of my eyes and words will sometimes be doubled on top of the word, and just trying to keep my eyes looking at one specific thing its like everything is slowly sliding up or my eye keep wanting to drag down im not sure which is happening. Now just trying to stand in place my legs get shaky and I'll even just fall to the right or forward, never backward or left. So I don't know whats going on and I wont see a doctor for 2 weeks but I am concerned letting whatever is going on go for another 2 weeks. I just dig some digging and things like Brain Tumor, Parkinson, and Nystagmus all had symptom that seemed close to what was happening which has me worried.  Other information: I'm also only a 21 year old male. Which seems like a young age to have this much going on with me. I hope it's all because of one thing and that its curable. I'll be checking this post, so If other information is needed I'll try to provide it ASAP.",

Remember the fall and severe pain in chest and the need to fall asleep.  Approximately 15 minutes later a friend carried me to the car, I was able to speak normally, although slightly confused. About 5 minutes later I started feeling a severe pain in my clavicle, the pain worsened and a few minutes later the hearing in my right ear cut off completely. I was taken to the emergency room, it was concluded that I had broken my right clavicle. Paralysed and confused from the pain, I can’t recall if I mentioned the hearing problem. Whilst lying in the bed in the hospital, my right ear started bleeding. I had ruptured my ear drum. I also had a concussion and took me a while to recall what had happened.  X-rays were taken of my shoulder and skull; the only evident broken bones were my right clavicle.  I was released from the hospital, as I do not have a medical aid. I spent the rest of the day sleeping and vomiting in the backseat of the car. I had been drinking the night before and was given morphine.  At about 17h00 that day, I attempted to move from the car to the bed. I couldn’t balance on my own, and became severely nauseous when upright or moving. My ear and back of my right shoulder were bruised, thus can be assumed that I fell directly on them. After 2 days the vertigo lessened significantly. I was able to walk slowly and by myself. I experienced and overwhelming sensation of tinnitus. To the extent that I struggled to hear in normal conditions, as it was so over powering.  Hearing didn’t return after a few weeks, went for an auditory test. The first ENT concluded that I had damaged the internal nerves. The second ENT had a different reason (I can’t recall). The same auditory test was done a few weeks later, but less of a distortion was heard. The audiologists didn’t think anything of this, and offered a cochlear implant.  Weeks after the incident, and after being cleaned by more than one specialist, an audiologist noted blood on my eardrum.  About 4 weeks after, for a few days, clear liquid uncontrollably expelled from my nose. I thought it to be sinuses, although I’d never experienced such problems. It was small amounts, but enough to need wiping away. It was completely clear and thin.  Within 6 weeks of the incident, I would hear loud noises in the right ear, but they would feel far away from the ear, as if the ear is hearing them, but not processing them as closely as it should. Sounds like drums, ie rather very loud.  I was cleared to fly in that time. While the aeroplane was descending, I was asleep and woken up to an extremely loud pop/bang in the broken ear. About a week later, after taking a shower, I felt something discharging from my ear. An ear bud revealed a watery, bloody substance.  I could hear very loud sounds, but they felt very far away and were not clear of perfect. Random clicking/tapping noise would be heard in broken ear, over the sound of tinnitus, and not as constant. Especially when getting up.  Strange tinnitus sounds were heard every now & again, a sound that sounded like something trying to connect. When I stood upright and held my head at a certain angle, the pressure in my broken ear would make me feel as if my head was going to explode, until I angled my head normally again.  November 2016 When touching my outer ear, the touch would trigger a shock to my tongue. At first it was subtle, but the feeling became more prominent and consistent. December 2016 I blew my nose normally (and quite hard) for the first time since the incident and heard my ear ‘pop’ for the first time. Before this, there was no sound at all, nor do I recall a feeling of eardrum movement. In a clavicle related check-up in September, a GP claimed that my eardrum was moving normally, but looking back, I don’t think he made the correct diagnosis.  Was driving long distances and ear felt like it wanted to equalise, sensation was slow, and didn’t feel relief. Felt like it went up to about 55%. January 2017 The shocking tongue sensation lessened, but transformed into moving my tongue from side to side causes a feeling of movement inside of my broken ear. I have this sensation to this day.  February onwards Feeling the need to equalise often, but to no avail. Pressure in head feels irritated, equalising eventually started working, but wasn’t always an optimal feeling. Mostly the pressure just felt better temporarily.  After equalising, I am able to hear loud sounds as a distortion. The sound is similar to that of bicycle training wheels, I hear this distortion until I swallow, and then everything cuts off again.  I started feeling a sharp pain in my ear and pain behind the bone of my ear. Ear often felt wet inside and itchy.  When pushing down on my tragus, sounds like it’s blocked and makes a wobbly echo at the end. Very loud and perfect sound, definitely not transferable over the skull to working ear.  Chewing sounds became very prominent, even in the broken ear. Could hear the water crashing to the floor in the shower, only certain sounds of, and sound felf far away, but still in the right ear.  Moving my head from side to side quickly, it sounds as if there is water inside the broken ear.  I started feeling like there is liquid running out of my ear, but it is completely dry.  July 2017 As time progressed, my tinnitus lessened immeasurably. Today, at times, I can barely hear it and is not affected by fatigue or external noise, as it was fir the first few months.  An accidental loud shout in the broken ear, and accidental slap, on several occasions, both caused the overwhelming tinnitus that I had first experienced and lasted a few days.  Found myself instinctively massaging the upper neck muscles on the right side. Physical exercise made my ear feel like it needs to equalise.  September 2017 I went to a loud music concert, the next day there was blood in right ear’s canal. I was working in a bar at the time, so loud music wasn’t something that I was completely estranged to, although this was louder than usual.  December 2017 Woke up to an extremely loud sound in ear. Like a bang or tear, its difficult to describe, but it was so loud that I lay still for a few minutes, scared to move as I thought I would break something.  January 2018 Can now hear my finger scratching in my ear canal. Isolated and clear, no distortion.  Can hear loud sounds like a blender, still not clear, but doesn’t feel as far away in skull as used to. Such loud sounds make my broken ear feel extremely uncomfortable afterwards. I start feeling sickly, as if I’m getting flu. The gland in my neck on the right side swells up and I feel like I’m getting a throat infection. This clears up after a few hours.  Feels as if there is a baby hair in my ear. Was given a neck massage and heard movement in ear – as if there was waves/ water in ear and moving.  February 2018 Equalised and for less than a second I could hear a “whole” sound – wasn’t distorted, and a lot closer than usual. Hasn’t happened again.  When I get out of bed very quickly, my tinnitus disappears for a few seconds. As if trying to find balance. Only happens sometimes.  Attended a ballet class and the jumps made my ear feel very uneasy.  1/20 times will actually feel relief when equalising.  May 2018 Hearing bones creek in broken ear, eg neck. Was listening to music, softly, could converse normally, picked up certain sounds as whistle sensations in broken ear.  Ear doesn’t produce any wax at all when compared to working ear. To this day I have done numerous auditory tests and seen 3 ENTs. None of them come to the same conclusion, nor have any interest in these strange symptoms. I don’t have a medical aid, so finding the right direction to go in has proved very challenging. After each hearing test, my tinnitus was excruciating.",Ear Problems

So I hope no one minds if I start a new thread? I may be having a bad experience, even though everyone told me it wasn't painful or a big deal. I had cataracts in both eyes--small ones, the doctor said. So I had the left one done a few weeks ago. They put me under. And it hurt! The next day when I went in, he said one of the stitches came out, and one was loose. So I have had to wait a month before returning to the doctor, with steroid drops x4/day. I'm scared something horrible has happened. It still hurts, eyesight is murky, headaches.  Without glasses: left eye sees better. With glasses: right eye sees better. I was so wanting to get it over quickly so I could buy some cute glasses (I went in to get a prescription, not knowing I had cataracts). Now I have to wait six weeks before even considering doing the right eye.

"Ear, Nose & Throat",https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/5811/ear-feels-clogged-hearing-a-hum-echo,"Ear Feels Clogged, Hearing A Hum/Echo","So this problem started around two months ago. I'm a 33 year old guy in good health who woke up one morning to find my left ear felt clogged. Within a few days, the problem went away on it's own and I felt back to 100%. A few weeks later, same problem. I woke up one morning and my left ear is clogged again. Just like the first time, a few days pass and I'm back to feeling normal. Well, I woke up on March 17th (which is going on about two weeks now) and lo and behold my left ear is clogged again. This time it hasn't gone away or shown any improvement. Now in addition to my ear feeling that sort of clogged/muffled feeling I'm also getting an annoying hum and at times an echo. Here's where things get strange though. Everything I have looked up on tinnitus describes people having a constant ring/hum/buzz, whatever you want to call it, that gets worse at night whenever things quiet down. I suppose this makes the noise more noticeable. This is the exact opposite of what I'm experiencing. When I lay down at night in silence, my ear makes no noise at all. I can sleep without a problem. It's when I get up and the noise of daily life begins, people talking, TV on, radio on, water running, doors closing, etc, is when my ear starts this very annoying hum/echo sound. If I put my finger in my ear to block out the noise, it immediately stops. If I'm in a quiet environment, it's not noticeable. It's as though something is going on inside my ear to where once the sound enters, it's being distorted because sound itself is triggering this noise. I've been to an ENT who said everything looked fine and was moving fine. She ruled out earwax and fluid in the ear as a cause. I have an appointment set for a hearing test and a followup with the ENT in a few weeks but I wanted to ask here in the meantime. Has anyone had a similar experience or have any suggestion as to what this could be? I thought it could be a eustachian tube problem but I didn't notice a bit of difference after trying some of the exercises shown on YouTube. Any help is appreciated and if I can be more specific or provide any further information, I'll be happy to. Thanks in advance.",Ear Problems

I have never had any issues with seizures or any major health problems. The doc I went to said they thought it was just the ear infection that made me disorientated. I still had the bad cold on top of the ear infection. I'm still coughing up phlegm daily. Antibiotics don't seem to be working and now both ears hurt still and the antibiotics make me go to the bathroom a lot sometimes. Days after starting meds, I still feel really weak and sick to my stomach a lot. Going to my GP doctor as I can get an appointment. Could something be low? I can't seem to focus on some tasks very well some days. I get up 1.5 hours before leaving for work because an hour isn't enough to get ready. I fall asleep on the couch way too early at night, hours before bedtime and just can't stay up later like I used to. What could be wrong with me? They did a strep test (negative) at the previous doctor that I went to, a flu test (negative) and refused to do blood work that I specifically asked them to do because they felt that I ""didn't need it"".

So about three years ago I started having theses episodes hit me. No specific time place or activity, although the first one I remember was when I was driving. It was a strong vertigo style onset. If I turned my head left or right it was like my vision was in stages. Like instead of smooth vision it was jumping. Real dizzy n light headed. Even vomiting with it. I had to pull over and have someone come get me. After an hour or so it passed but left a bad headache and extreme fatigue. I started having those episodes more and more frequently. It went from maybe once a month to a week to daily until it got so intense I couldn’t function. The “episodes” stopped but left me with a constant symptom. From the time I wake up till I go to bed I’m always dizzy, of balance and really fatigued. I’ve been to a neurologist who saw a spot on the back of my brain and said I either had a stroke or it was something I was born with. After further test he determined I was born with it and it was no concern. I’ve been to several ent’s. Ended up having surgery on both ears. Can’t remember technical term but basically had to have a bone graft in each ear to repair holes in the inner ears. Same surgery but two different procedures. This has been over the last year n a half. But still no fix. Now I’m constantly in a fog and still have strong episodes. I do good to go to work and come home just to lay down. Now I take klonopin daily. It doesn’t fix the problem. Just helps cope. I have had panic attacks from it. Multitudes of tests. But nothing to determin or fix the issue. Any ideas or help would be appreciated as I don’t know what else to do and I am mentally and physically broken from it. Side notes. I’m 44 yo and approx 10 years ago was diagnosed with ocular phyringial(know I butchered the spelling) style md. But no one acts like that plays any factor into this issue. Thanks in advance.",

Like sometimes it's just hard for me to go to school and I guess I don't feel valid to miss those days because I'm not feeling well, because you physically can't see anything wrong with me. I'm in the process of trying to get accommodations for it through my school, but I feel like my professors won't really understand. I'm going to start physical therapy soon and I don't know how its going to make me feel since I already feel bad on my own from doing nothing, and I haven't been prescribed any medication yet. I just I don't really know what to do because I just honestly don't feel valid, I don't really know how to explain it. My mom seems to understand a little bit but my dad is giving me the impression of ""its really not that bad come on"" which I mean I can understand he can't see it, but if he knew what pain I go through on a daily basis he'd understand. Like sometimes my clothes make my skin burn, any light scrape on my skin burns, or if I hit my arm or even lay my arm on my desk my skin becomes inflamed and hurts. I'm just kinda lost in what to do because I don't know anyone that knows anywhere close to being me.

This is not new to me as i have had sinusitis on and off for the better part of my life and have had low level tinnitus in my right ear for the past 4 years or so it usually pops back after a half hour or so. It was late so I went to sleep. About 4am I woke up and my ear was completely clogged (couldnt hear anything) and the tinnitus was now so loud I couldn't hear myself think. I went to the doctor and he gave me some antibiotics for a throat infection and some prednisone for the inflammation in case there was an issue in my inner ear. Two days later I went to the ENT. They performed hearing tests and confirmed that I had little to no hearing in my right ear but the outer ear including my ear drum was fine and healthy. They also confirmed no fluid buildup in my middle ear. The ENT upped the dosage of prednisone to 50mg per day for 5 days and put me on a longer cycle. He also sent me to get an MRI on my right auditory region which i am going to on Thursday.  It has now been one week since the occurred and nothing has gotten better the hearing or the tinnitus. I am hoping that they find something on the MRI because absent of that how the heck can an act of blowing ones nose cause this. Thanks",Ear Problems

I broke my nose about 8 years ago on a trampoline.. My friend pushed me and my knees slammed it upwards, with great force. Ever since then, its gotten progressively worse. I'm at a point now where i can hardly look in the mirror, but also has the most pressure and irritation ever. Its beyond sensitive and became inflammed very easily. Netipots with fresh aloe is the only way to manage, but its become constant and need to do less. The biggest problem now is any physical activity, causing the bones to shift and more black and blue around eyes! The worst part of this whole thing, is every doctor says the same thing.. They can't change the structure or fix sinuses, that only they can straighten septum. That its impossible to fix. I'm just beyond hopeless and living a pretty restricted dull life, at this point.

It makes no sense to straighten a septum when the bones are shifting and misplaced.. I already had septoplasty, and the septum is crooked again. How is it possible that no one can fix the outer structure of a nose, which should help pressure and sinus? Any advice is appreciated, Thank you",Nasal Problems
"Ear, Nose & Throat",https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/51962/where-would-i-get-this-extraordinary-smelling-ability-tested,Where would I get this extraordinary smelling ability tested?,"My age is 49, my sex is male, and I am caucasian. All indications are that I have an extremely rare ability (not sure even how rare, I am sure other people have it, but I could be the only person on the planet to do it at this extreme) autustic ability regarding smell. Before you read this, please do not dismiss what I am about to say as impossible, because I already had some of this ability tested at my doctor's office and it has atleast been verified that I can do it well enough that it is beyond a normal person's abilities. Furthermore my parents have witnessed me do it all my life. And lastly it took like 8 hours of search on the internet (thats how rare it is to find info on this) to find a reference by a medical doctor who talks about a rare occurence with fibromyalgia that can also happen with autistic patients because of how both disabilities effect the central nervous system. As I understand it, some fibromyalgia and autistic patients only require maybe a 1000th of the stimuli from a sensory gland of a normal person to detect something, because of how their central nervous system gets stimulated so much more easily or reacts much more faster (not sure which). The reference on the internet I found speaks of fibromyalgia patients who can hear the humming of the ballast tubes in flourescent lights that no normal human can hear, because of their central nervous system. That reference also refers to the possibility of it also effecting a fibromyalgia or autistic's sense of smell. In my case, almost all my senses are effected to some extent but smell seems to be effected the greatest. Let me give some examples. When I was around 18. I was in my bedoom behind a closed door, with tape all over the door to keep smells out (thats how sensitive I am to smells), and I am like 40 feet away from the kitchen and my sister cooks a tv dinner (like fish with white wine source). Both my mother and sister are standing 3 or 4 feet from the microwave and can't smell the alcohol. I smell it behind the taped door in my bedoom, from 40 feet away. I also smell odors thru walls, thru pipes, etc. Recently, just happened a couple months ago, I smelled something like a dead animal when I was in a car (the smell was overwhelming to me). Both my parents were in the front of the car and couldn't smell something that was overwhelming to me, and it wasn't until the moving car went for another couple minutes that my parents could finally smell it. So maybe 200 to 300 feet or perhaps more feet in distance before they could pick up the smell. Just another case of how much farther away I can smell stuff then normal people. And as I mentioned earlier my doctors office tested and verified that I wasn't just imagining this ability. I go to a therapist for my autism. The therapist told me that he put a tiny amount of cleaning stuff on a chair to test me (I was unaware that he did it until after the test was over). A patient came in 15 minutes later, and even sat in the chair and could not smell it. Then a patient came in an hour later and sat in chair, and couldn't smell it. Then another in 2 hours, then another in 3 hours. I came in 4 hours later and smelled it, as soon as I opened the door, and could even state where the smell is coming from, the chair. The same therapist also tested me another 20 to 30 times, and each time I correctly identified the smell, and it was a smell that was too weak for normal people to pick up. And today, believe it or not, I smelled better then a gas detection meter. I'm getting tired of typing so will summarize quickly. I lived next to gas stoves for 32.5 years and never reported a gas leak. What are the mathematical odds, if you pick a random day in 32. 5 years to just report that you smell gas and there really is a leak, and it is just coincidence? The gas man is saying it is impossible because his meter (which apparently isn't as accurate as me) didn't pick up the smell in the hallway, when I smelled gas coming from a neighbor's apartment. Never reported something like this in 32.5 years of being around gas stoves. The day I reported it, the gas man, goes into the apartment and checks the stove and there is a leak (I was correct). And just to be clear again: I walked in front of every apartment in the building, didn't smell gas at any, except for the one where the gas man actually said there was a leak and I never reported a gas leak in 32.5 years of being around gas stoves. It would be around a 1 in 60,000 (or higher) mathematical probability that it was done by random chance. The gas detection meter couldn't detect the gas in the hallway, but the only way I could of known which apartment out of all of them in the building had the leak, and the only way I could of reported this on the correct day of the leak (when I never reported a gas leak in 32.5 years) is it was NOT random chance or coincidence. At this point, I really like to find out what is going on and get as close to an exact number to how much better I smell then a normal person. I live in Pennsylvania, but I could travel if necessary.

She had been using a nasal corticosteroid daily for the past 6 months as directed by her PMD. She added pseudoephedrine without relief of symptoms. Her symptoms became markedly worse on about day 4, with increased pressure and pain in her cheeks, increased nasal drainage, and worsening nighttime cough. There were no fever, facial redness or swelling, diplopia or other visual changes, epistaxis, chest pain, shortness of breath or pedal edema. She reported a mild sore throat and mild ear pressure, but no pain. She has a history of CAD and hypothyroidism, both stable and controlled with medication.

I guess my story is probably similar to many of yours. For the best part of these 10 years I was in the most awful state imaginable. I was close many times to just run the car into the next tree and make this misery an end. I have had gabapentin, Cymbalta and many other drugs that did not help me at all, if anything the side effects made it even less worth living. We emigrated and so got a new doctor. Although he really tried to help but I guess he didn't know how. However during one check-up he had a flash of inspiration and prescribed me Arnica-Betula compound drops - yes a homeopathic remedy - and yes I went home in tears, thinking what a waste of money but low and behold no more burning muscles in my body and the fibro fog had also disappeared - a miracle in my eyes. A little bit later he put me on Spiricort for something completely unrelated but it worked for the Fibro, the arthritis in the whole of my spine, and all the destroyed discs too. And by accident I discovered that a protein shake in the morning made a massive, massive difference to me. I actually have now a bit of get up and go- something I could only dream of before. In the last 2 months I have been able to clean and sort out my whole house- something I am really proud of having achieved. Without the help of the drops, the tablets and the shakes totally impossible. I also take the vit D3 of course, when necessary i.e. when my bones hurt.

I’m a 31 year old male. The pain is a stabbing/tender pain under my left pectoral muscle bordering on my armpit, and is there most of the time at varying degrees. At times it’s also accompanied by nausea (felt in my throat), occasional headaches, neck, shoulder and middle back pain. I also have ankle pain most of the time in both ankles and a bad right wrist (wrist is most likely from a bicycle crash 2 years ago).  In the last year, I’ve been to the ER twice, and both times the EKG and blood work came back fine. The second time, they did a CT scan of my upper left chest and found nothing wrong.   I’ve also visited with my PCP, who did a comprehensive metabolic panel and a couple other blood tests, all of which came back fine. She also ordered chest Xrays, which came back negative for anything wrong with the lungs or chest area.  She referred me to a cardiologist, who ordered a lipid panel for cholesterol. Cholesterol levels came back fine, with all levels bordering on ideal or not worrisome. I also did a stress echo at the cardiologist, and he said that nothing is wrong with my heart.  I went to a gastroenterologist, and he recommended an upper endoscopy, which I just had today. He stated after that my throat, stomach, and intestines looked completely normal and that he took biopsies which I will have the result for in 1-2 weeks. He prescribed me a proton pump inhibitor, because in the last few months I’ve seen my conditions improve on/off with these (not sure if they’ve actually helped or not).  At this point, I’m just not sure where to turn. Seems I have a lot of the symptoms of Fibromyalgia (I also urinate frequently and have anxiety/depression over the situation), but I’m not convinced the chest pain is from that because for one I’m male (mostly females get Fibro), and secondly from what I’ve seen chest/armpit pain doesn’t normally line up with the normal Fibro pain spots.  If anyone has any ideas what may be going on here, I’d love to hear them. I’m going to follow up with my PCP once I get my biopsy results, but want to make sure it’s a productive conversation to move things forward. Thanks so much for reading, and good luck to everyone! I really want this to go away!!",

Eventually it turned into an ear infection. I didn't see a doctor and after almost 3 weeks it eventually got to the point that it was painful to even put a phone to my ear. What got me to see someone is that it started to spread to the left side of my face, I started to get really bad headaches, and I was waking up from my sleep shaking. Throughout all this I never got a fever. I finally went and was put on amoxicillin clavulanate and some ear drops...forgot what they were. The infection started to clear up and by the 10th and last day I only had the tiniest bit of pain if I manually wiggled my ear but all other symptoms gone.  About 3 days later my symptoms started coming back. This time it wasn't focused in my ear but instead to the back of my neck and head. Headaches and shaking came back but I also started to find it hard to focus. Still no fever. The doctor gave me a Z Pack but told me to wait 3 days to take it cuz my ear looked fine and I didn't have a fever; that this could be a viral infection.  I waited but only got worse so I took the Z pack and noticed really quick improvements. I swear I could feel it fizzing inside of my face, jaw, and back of my head. But again, by the time I took the last pill it seemed that I was on the verge of getting fully cured, just the tiniest of pain on the back of my head.  I felt fine for maybe 5 days but then the cycle started again. Severe headaches, stiff neck so bad that I couldn't rest my head on my pillow to sleep, I had to sleep in a seated position. Again it was hard to focus and I would have some confusion. Twice I went to my car and opened the passenger's side door instead of driver's side. I went to call out from work and I forgot what I was doing, then when I remembered, I forgot how to do it. This happened fri night and I didn't get to the doctor till monday and by then miraculously I had already started to feel better...not great but now at my worst. Again I was told that it was probably a virus and that it's on it's way out. That was two days ago. The feeling of being sick never went away but I felt..ok, until now. Headache is back, pains, and shivering as I type this but still, no fever at all. 98 temp. Idk what to do anymore, I just feel that I need to be on antibiotics for longer than a week but with no visible sign of infection I feel like I'm going to be told to go home and wait it out again. Tomorrow will be 2 months with the only days I felt normal was towards the end of antibiotics. I'm worried that it might be meningitis but that seems to be more sudden than my prolonged infection.

I went in to urgent care last summer for an ear infection in my right ear. They said they didn't see anything and I was fine. I insisted I wasn't, so they gave me ear drops. They didn't give me any directions on how long and often to use them though. I went scuba diving in January, and the two months after I was having these recurring ear infections in my right ear that would last a few days and go away, because I'd use my extra ear drops. I also noticed when I equalized my ears, the right one would make a long, loud squealing noise. I finally decided to get it checked by urgent care because they seemed to be getting worse and I noticed my nose kept running. Turns out, I had a sinus infection that went untreated for a long time, most likely from last summer, so there was fluid in my ear. They said scuba diving just aggravated it. They gave me the same ear drops but with instructions this time. I used them daily as well as Flonase and Zrytec. She said to do it for two months and if it doesn't get better, to go to an ENT specialist. The ear infection and runny nose have gone away. My only concern is, when I equalize my ears now, my right now seems muffled. I have another dive trip planned for August.

Towards the end of our trip, she developed a cold, which I caught two days later. Up to a couple of days ago, I was exhibiting normal cold-like symptoms: lightly scratchy sore throat, mild cough, and sinus congestion. I was given an over-the-counter medication in France that is similar to Mucinex, and I've been taking that for about six days.  Upon my arrival home four days ago, I was feeling much better but noticed that the congestion had moved to my ears and seemingly stagnated. Yesterday I woke up with mild balance issues and vertigo. I went about my day normally, but was nauseous by the end of the day.  Late last night, I quickly developed chills that got worse over time. Thinking I probably had a fever, I took my temperature and was shocked to see that it was 96.3 degrees. I was slowly getting colder. I immediately put un multiple layers of clothing and a heavy blanket and was able to get myself back into the 98 degree range after about four hours. My questions are these: Could my sudden drop in temperature be related to my cold and possible inner-ear issues? If not, what could it have been caused by? Could my inner-ear issues be caused by something other than my cold and congestion? P.S.  My girlfriend is now fine, and did not exhibit any ear or temperature problems when she had her cold.","Ear Problems , Cold , Nasal Problems"

I am a 15 yr old female and my main problem is a fullness/popped/clogged feeling that has been happening in only my left ear multiple times a day for sometimes hours and hours at a time for three months. Nothing else is wrong with interior of my ear; no pain, ringing, etc just a feeling of fullness. I went to my pediatrician about a month ago regarding these little hard pea sized bumps growing in my ear lobe under the skin. I was referred to an ENT who said it was blocked oil glands and nothing to worry about so i briefly mentioned the popping and he said it was nothing to worry about also. A couple weeks ago when looking up what i could have, some symptons of mine were related to cancer but i knew it was rare, but can happen so i checked my lymph nodes first and found that i have a slightly swollen lymph node on the right side of my neck (posterior cervical) which is a little longer than the lenght of a quarter and witdth of a finger nail. I also noticed one the shape of a pea directly under it. And on that same side of neck at the bottom of my ear i noticed a hard pea size lump last night that grew rapidly. So worried that one side of my head has an ear that continues to pop with ""blocked oil gland cyst"" on it and the other side of my head has swollen lymph nodes i told my mom to book a doctors appointment for today. MY doctor looked in my ear and said she saw nothing abnormal and said that it was also normal for lymphnodes to swell, she diagnosed me with fluid in my ear which she thinks it is and prescribed me with 3 alllergy medicines for two weeks to see if it helps and if not i go to the ENT again to see about ETD.

I had a balloon sinuplasty 2 weeks ago due to chronic sinusitus. I do not have a deviated septum. The procedure was incredibly uncomfortable (I would never do it out-patient if I would've known the amount of pain I'd feel), the first week was terrible, and I am still experiencing excruciating facial pressure, particularly in my cheeks, which comes in waves. I have already switched ENTs since the ENT who did the procedure told me it was okay to have an 8-hour nosebleed on the day of the procedure (not just tinted with blood but blood literally running down my face like a sieve) and a 3-hour bleed a week later after he attempted to pull one of my scabs off (he was wrong and I lost enough blood that my hemoglobin level is now below-normal). My new ENT is great and wants to look more at my allergies (I am allergic to some molds) but I am curious if anyone else had this much pain following this procedure. She started me on a course of antibiotics today and I'm hoping it helps because I'm taking Tylenol every 4 hours and waking up in the middle of the night with incredible pain once it wears off. I use saline nasal spray four times a day, follow an anti-inflammatory diet, do acupressure, use steam/warm moist heat packs on my face, and use the neti pot when not suffering from nosebleeds. I had to stop Motrin/other NSAIDS because they were partly responsible for the severity of the nosebleeds I had post-op. I just keep reading hw people go back to work the next day and I am astounded. The pressure in my face is still terrible. The ent that did the procedure never mentioned anything to me about it being painful or the recovery period beforehand, but when I saw him last week, he said it's a 90-day recovery period.

He had also at that time had arthritis lab work done to rule out any other type of arthritis. I have been through very many traumatic events and emotional and stressful situations. He gave me a prescription for Savella, I took it for just a little while because I didn't like the side effects. After I stopped talking that, I was going through quite a few different types of surgeries... Gallbladder, ear, nose... After that I was moving alot because my fiance's job requirements were to move around and he wanted me to go with him. So yadda.. Yadda... Fast forward to the past year. My body feels as if it is being crushed little by little. Six months ago I went back to my original family Dr and told him how I was feeling. I ask him if he would let me try Savella one more time to see if there was any change in whether it helped me or not. Well, it didn't and I still didn't like the way it made me feel. So he wrote me a prescription for Lyrica, that wasn't any better at all. Then came Cembalta.... That medicine landed me in the ER. I didn't know what the heck was going on with me. My head was spinning, I was very dizzy.. It was horrible. I went into the ER feeling so bad that the Dr actually did a CTscan, just to mention one thing he did. I told my family Dr about this so he sent me to a rheumatologist. This Dr had me do lots of lab work and wasn't able to do anything at that time for me, we're waiting for the lab work to come in now. Anyway... I have a huge question that I'm praying that Someone.. Anyone can help me with, considering NONE of these meds works for me.. At All... Is there any hope somewhere out there for me?

I checked my throat then and noticed a little white stuff growing on my tonsils, very similar to that of strep. Told my family, but since it wasn’t not a lot, and they could not see it, they presumed I was crazy. Went to the doctor for other medical reasons, brought it up to her, she waved it off as a sinus infection - never thoroughly checked. I went back shortly after still not feeling well, she gave me a strep and mono test, both negative. Went to the ER for other health problems, mentioned my throat there (and by this point there was quite A LOT of white patches on my tonsils, specifically my right - it would then spread to my left). Doctor there said it was an upper respiratory infection and told me to keep gargling salt water (also tested for strep - came back negative). So I did...and it got worse...and worse. I tried this TelADoc thing through my insurance and sent a picture of my throat to the doctor who would be calling me. Right off the bat he said it was strep and sent 500mh amoxicillin to my pharmacy. That did NOT help, ended up getting worse. Made another doctors appointment at urgent care, they tested for strep, negative as well. But this time he prescribed me azithromycin, 500mg for 5 days. While it has definitely helped my throat a bit, my left ear still has a bit of pain. I just took the third pill today. The right side of my throat feels perfectly fine, it’s a little sore when I rub it. But my left is still a little more tender, a little pain when i swallow, and my ear. My question is, although this medicine does appear to be working (the pain I had before it was unbearable, it felt like I was swallowing glass), should I go back to an ENT? I just want to know what exactly caused this. I’m very hygienic when it comes to my mouth, seriously - like brush, floss, 10 times a day hygienic. I was reading up about some other things it could be, and I was wondering if anyone else ever had these symptoms? The white patches in the back of my throat have definitely decreased in size, but that Is partially because I took a q tip and said I had enough and started scraping it off. It did bleed very little, in only certain areas, so I stopped. I called the doctor back and he said the 500mg for 5 days should definitely knock whatever’s in my system, but I just wanna know exactly what IT is...anyone had anything similar to this? Guess I just need some reassurance. Thanks","Ear Problems , Throat Problems"

It’s pretty common and usually caused by allergies or an infection from a virus or bacteria. Usually pink eye is irritating but it does not affect your vision. Because it can be contagious, you want to make sure that you know what is causing your pink eye and how to treat it, so it doesn’t spread to your other eye or to other people. Though we don’t generally recommend homeopathic treatments for pink eye, there are definitely home remedies that you can try. Even pink eye caused by bacteria can clear up in 1-2 weeks without antibiotic treatment in 50% of cases. You can make a homemade saline solution by mixing 1 cup of distilled water with 1-2 teaspoons of salt. You can apply that solution to your closed eye with a clean cotton ball. Make sure not to use the same cotton ball again on the other eye. Compresses (either cold or warm) can also help if you apply them for a few minutes several times a day. Consider using over-the-counter artificial tears. While you have pink eye do not use contact lenses or eye-make up. You can also check this link out for more information.",

I am getting desperate & I can only imagine how my husband feels. My husband has had roaming joint pain for maybe five years now. It will move from his left elbow to his right foot to his right middle finger without reason. This used to occur sporadically - maybe once a month to once every two months & last from a few hours to a few days. He was also extremely fatigued, napping every day after work & every weekend. He did seem to feel sick more than ""the average person"" as well with headaches & flu like symptoms often. In the past two years it has gotten extremely worse. There have been virtually no breaks in the pain. Some days he can barely walk after getting out of bed. Let me say that he is fairly healthy, in his 40's & not remotely overweight (6 feet, 170 pounds). This now seems to be affecting not only his joints but also his tendons & fascia. He will have swelling above one of his knees (also red & warm), his finger will swell to almost twice it's size & occasionally he will be unable to bend his wrist or straighten his finger. The pain/swelling is still roaming - there seems to be no rhyme or reason to where it will show up.  He is still exhausted. It is hard for him to get up for work & he is down for a nap as soon as he gets home from work. It is not unusual for these naps to last through the night. He naps most of the weekend as well. He is also now in pain while he is sleeping/laying down. He will often moan during the night & last night I found him in the chair because it hurt too bad to lie down.  On the days that he does wake up feeling ok, it is usually short lived & he will be back in pain before the end of the day. His blood test have come back normal for the most part. He has been tested for Lyme disease a few times & it has been negative. The only thing that tested positive (once) was ANA. The rheumatologist however said that was inconclusive.  We've been less than pleased with the 2 rheumatologist we have seen - they seem to blow this off. Our GP has been great, but there doesn't seem to be much he can do other than refer us to a rheumatologist. It is very frustrating to see him in this much pain & not have a plan of action. He has almost given up on doctors. I just cannot imagine him having to suffer for the rest of his life.  There has got to be something that can be done, but we just have not been able to diagnose this. I am hoping that someone will recognize these symptoms & be able to give us their experience.

He told me to sit upside down on my head on a couch, push and blow air into my head as hard as I could while he held my ears closed, and I held my nose and mouth closed so the air had nowhere to go. I did not see rainbows.  Since I am not there, hypothetically speaking what kind of damage could have occured from doing this? I've heard others online say things like herniated sinus, damage to vagus nerve, cranial damage, etc. I've also heard people say anxiety, but my eyes become bloodshot after bending over, that's a direct physiological response, I don't just have anxiety. I would like to know what to tell the doctor or what kind of tests I should have. I've told him and haven't been referred to anyone for it. I'll be seeing a physical therapist in a month for my back, I'll tell him about the head or nasal issues.  Symptoms: When I bend over forward or tilt my head too far (other triggers too see below) my eyes become red and burn, vision a little blurred. I feel pain somewhere I think in my nasal cavity. I feel like there is some kind of unequal pressure in my head and pain as I move it around like my brain is swollen or it feels like I have painful moving jelly in my head. It becomes a lot harder to think, foggy thinking. I have difficulties remembering things. While its happening I have a lot less energy, my heart feels stressed if I try to run while feeling like this, I feel a throbbing sensation in my fingers and other places. Sudden or inconsistent sounds and or lights feel like they are ""grabbing"" at my heart or cause a little pain in my head. Some kind of slight epilepsy? (I also had a head injury a little before then see below) I think I've had a couple of small seizures. I feel like I need to keep my head as level as I can and can't tilt it past a certain point.  Also when laying down I get tiny air bubbles that trickle out of one of my nostrils making a tick, tick sound, even when I hold my breath, doesn't seem to be coming from my lungs. Not sure if that's related.  Symptom Triggers: Some are stronger than others. If I bend over and it triggers the symptoms, that can last all day. Other triggers don't make it last as long.  Pushing when pooping or farting. Tilting my head too far. Breathing through my nose or blowing my nose. Swallowing. Sucking. Sneezing.  ----- Now years later with a possible back injury, when walking I feel pain in my heels (does not radiate throughout legs) each time I feel pain in my heels I feel a corresponding pain in my head. It seems like Sciatica, except from what I've read Sciatica doesn't radiate to the head. Rolling my heels slightly, or being on uneven surfaces feels like it pinches my heels and at the same time causes a pinching pain feeling in my head and each step triggers some or all of the above symptoms temporarily or for longer time.  Before all of this when I was in 7th grade I was running fast in the hallway at school. I dropped my lunch box outward and while running I bent over to attempt to retrieve it and with my head tilted down I hit my head on the corner of a wall hard. I then had a big pool of blood about a few feet wide on the ground. I was taken to a small clinic up in the mountains and they only gave me stitches. No ER room, no tests. The scar is about four inches long. Maybe that has something to do with part of it such as the epilepsy like symptoms? Cranial damage which makes my head not feel solid? When I tilt my head I feel unequal pressure in my head depending on how I tilt it. I didn't feel these symptoms after hitting my head, only after I blew air hard into my head about a year later.",Nasal Problems

This was found in 2000 by a chiropractor who took x-rays before treatment and found the evidence of healed fractured and one of my vertibre out of position moved forward towards my spinal cord. This after 4 years of doctors appointments and drugs and me complaining about the the pain and numbness. My back was stabilize P.T. and chiropractic treatment got vertebrae back almost normalized but pain and numbness in the right leg always there. Rheumatologist started me on Cymbalta in the summer 0f 2016 and I started having twitching in my toes and feet at first mild but in April 2017 I was rear ended while waiting to make a left turn and the impact refractured my L-4 and L-5 vertebrae in my lower back. I didn't think I was hurt at the time and I am a Georgia middle school teacher and I finished working out the school year but my back started hurting progressively worse and I couldn't stand up for more than just a few minutes before I had to sit down because of the pain. My school administrators used this as a was of being able to not give me a contract for this year. They said I could resign for medical reasons instead of them saying I couldn't do the job and a letter stating that that they were not giving me a contract was because I couldn't do the job. Even though they knew I was under doctors care for the accident. After jumping through insurance company hoops I had spinal fusion and disc replacement surgery in December and slow recovery the twitching in my toes and feet is worse than ever and some days my back hurts so bad I can hardly stand up. I now have no insurance and no job and to make matters worse the day after surgery my mother suddenly got sick and passed away. She was disabled and on home dialysis and I was her sole caretaker but she was in relatively good health given her problems and we had just seen her specialists.

Looks like the opposite of tunnel vision.,"Two months ago (March) I had a migraine that lasted for a week. When it finally went away, I started getting really bad neck pains and my eyesight was bad.( This has happened twice before in the last two years but they were so spread apart that I couldn't remember how long it lasted each time.) Just before my migraine started, I went to the doctor's for help with my weight and I was put on Levothyroxine 125mg because i have an underactive thyroid and I hadn't taken my medicine in years. I also majorly changed my diet. Everyone who I would talk to blamed the migraine and neck pains on the major changes, but that wouldn't explain why it happened in the past. So I decided that I would wait it out and bring it up to my doctor in two weeks at my next appointment. When I brought everything up and explained the best I could about my vision, my doctor did very basic neurological tests to rule out the vision loss being a problem in my brain. She decided that it wasn't anything neurological and it was just a symptom of the migraine and it could be lasting longer because not only were my hormones out of wack (just ended my period), but I also made a very big lifestyle change. I was given a shot for the neck pains and was prescribed migraine medicine. The shot lasted two days and my eyes weren't any better. That was at the very end of March. Fast-forward to now when I just noticed my neck doesn't hurt anymore but my eyes... I start college in the fall and I don't have my license because I can't drive because I can't see.  I basically am going through the opposite of tunnel vision, but only sometimes (it's happened twice while typing this). It happens all the time everyday. If I'm looking at one thing then look at something else and go back to what I was looking at before, I can't see it. It also happens when I open my eyes after sleeping, if I blink longer than usual, and when I stand up and change rooms. Most times I can see with my peripheral vision but, occasionally, all vision goes away for the most part of a minute. When I can't see, it's not pitch black but it's almost like a snowy tv channel. It sometimes seems like it's brought on by light changes but I don't know. If you have has a similar experience, let me know. It would be great to know I'm not the only one. More importantly, if you know what this is or what's causing it, please let me know cause I got tired of this after one day, it's been almost 60 now.",Vision Loss

I had been having ""flare ups"" prior to the diagnosis since 2016 but didn't know what it was since I have other medical issues as well. I then noticed last year it became increasingly difficult to concentrate and focus. I had no idea what was going on. So, I spoke with my neurologist and she put me on Zoloft. It didn't help at all and I was on it for 6 weeks. She then prescribed me Effexor which she said would most likely be more effective. It started working almost immediately. I felt alive again. The depression and feelings of anxiety started to decrease and I've been taking it ever since. I then saw a Rheumatologist who diagnosed the fibromyalgia in the first appointment. The trigger points on my body are in my neck. Once my neck starts to hurt, the pain travels down my back, arms, legs, and abdomen. It is the worst pain ever. I am now on Lyrica for the fibromyalgia and it's been helping. But I must say in order to keep the ""flare ups"" at bay, your diet has to change. Your diet contributes a great deal to the ""flare ups."" Sugar, carbs, and soda are major factors.

I had been having low-grade fevers on a daily basis, joint pain and general aches, and fatigue so bad I would sleep for 16 hours. My blood work came back with normal CBC, but positive for mono. I was given prednisone (which did nothing) and told I would feel better in a week or two. 5 months later, my symptoms have only gotten worse. With my fevers come a bright red butterfly shaped rash across my face, and I am often too sick to get out of bed. I visited the doctor once again, who agreed that the fevers were not likely caused by the mono I had five months ago. She thought there was a chance of an autoimmune condition, so tested my ANA, CRP, CBC, ESR, and for lyme (for good measure). Yet, every single test came back within the normal range. I had been treated for kidney pain recently as well, but all that showed up in my urine was a little protein and white blood cells (but not an amount too excessive). With having tested negative for lupus, lyme, and any sort of infection, I do not know what to think. My fevers have not subsided, and the rash on my face shows up a few times a week at least (it's not itchy, just hot). I also continuously break out in hives, despite having had allergy testing (not sure if this is related).

For instance, if I am looking to the bottom left corner of my vision (my right eye is looking towards my nose) then my right eye feels strained and loses vision to where if I continue to look that direction that eye will completely black out. It seems almost like when I look that far the blood gets cut off and cuts my vision and then when I look center again the blood comes back to that eye. It is only temporary for however long I look with a bit of recovery time (seconds) depending on how long I looked. Sometimes it induces a headache if i persist for too long, but generally the pain is only associated with the actual action of looking and goes away as soon as I look center. Is this normal?

When I described my symptoms he said it might be a retinal tear so they took photos of my retinas and did ultrasounds on my eyes, but didn't find anything. I still felt like my eyes were bothering me but now in the form of occasional blurry vision and increased floaters, but I thought it was probably just in my head. I suffer from anxiety and have been sure I had something terrible going on when it was really nothing before, but it's been under control and that hasn't happened for the last 3-4 years. A few weeks ago I had what I think was another ocular migraine with no headache, because I didn't want to go back to the doctor for nothing and did some research on my own, and again the symptoms were identical. A few days later I started having pain in the upper corner of my left eye socket when I looked up, which is normally is the start of sinus issues for me. That lasted a couple of days then went away. About the same time I started having intense episodes of fatigue and feelings of muscle weakness in my arms and legs (mostly my knees felt weak), and I noticed my hands tremble frequently. I also feel like I was have trouble concentrating and feel very out-of-it at times. I again explained it all away as anxiety as I've had those symptoms before when my anxiety flared up. I wrote it off as not getting enough sleep and putting in new floors which caused a lot of knee-bending that I'm not used to. But I finally went to my doctor because in the past those symptoms have always gone away within a few hours once the anxiety passed. But now I'm starting to worry because they've lasted for a few weeks. These symptoms also feel a lot more intense than what I felt during past anxiety. I went to my regular doctor and had a hard time describing what was going on because I didn't take the time before hand to sort it out and write it down. He ended up checking my vitals and looking in my ears. He found fluid behind my ear drums and said that one looked discolored, a grayish color. He said that I have a sinus infection and prescribed antibiotics. I haven't taken them because I don't really have any symptoms of a sinus infection other than the brief headache that has been gone for weeks and I really don't want to take antibiotics for nothing. I'm hoping someone can tell me if the symptoms I described really are common for a sinus infection, and that could be what's going on even with no stuffy nose, no post nasal drip, and no sensation of pressure. Or should I try to get a second opinion? I really feel like something is wrong but I've been ""burned"" so many times by health anxiety in the past that I don't trust myself.",

This condition struck me hard last year when it appeared in March 2016 after coming off a major amount of psychiatric medication because of the trauma that happened when I was 13 years old. There is no reason to hold back on the trauma as it will be published I hope One day called Victim.I was actually wrote I love use at the age of 13 and kept it to myself for 34 years trying to leave the Earth because of what happened. Then I decided to wean myself off the medication and turn my life around and then out came fibromyalgia. I went to my GP is they could not be bothered to even check out my symptoms and just piled in so much morphine upon me I ended up in a chronic condition yet again. I had to self diagnose myself over a three day period ruling out everything that could possibly be causing the pain I was horrified when I found out that it was fibromyalgia and slammed down the document in front of my GP Dr Keil and even he could not be bothered to sort out the problem medication which I’m on now call gabapentin. I note that all of you are taking different medication out there but the suffering that I’m in during the fact that none of the GPs in Wales in UK bother to even instruct or help me makes my life even more difficult. So what do I do in life do I continue to suffer do I ended all as my partner does not want me to have even the authority to conserve my safety because the abuse and I went through and because also the GPs do not bother in this country at all. It will be interesting to see what replies I get to this party soon being the fact that you’re in the USA I too wish I was there I would’ve had more help then continue suffering like this and also having to enjoy the pain of arthritic knees every single night again trying to get that done is just as bad and the NHS being in crisis is affecting me big time. It’s a diabolic situation to be in diabolic pain threshold to have to content with.

Fibromyalgia,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/fibromyalgia/28205/fibro-and-chronic-pain,FIBRO AND CHRONIC PAIN,"This is an article that I just read. All wrong.  What they are not telling you. There are treatments for Chronic Pain....Lidocaine Infusions 6 treatments a year and covered OHIP Treatment Many patients start off their journey with fibromyalgia by seeing their primary care physician. After a thorough work-up, these general practitioners usually send patients to doctors who specialize in pain conditions. One possible physician you may encounter would be a rheumatologist, particularly if rheumatoid arthritis or lupus is suspected. In most cases, the patient will be treated for the chronic pain condition by a pain management physician, and they will coordinate other treatments in conjunction with the primary care doctor. The front line treatment for fibromyalgia by pain management doctors is medications. As mentioned above, antidepressants are often prescribed for mood adjustment, but they are also quite effective in relieving pain. Cymbalta is an anti-depressant that has been studied and found to be effective in treating the pain of fibromyalgia. In addition, anti-seizure medications, such as Lyrica, can also help with the fibromyalgia pain. Muscle relaxants, such as baclofen, and anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen, are also used to control pain. By combining these medication types, most patients experience pain relief. Opioids are not generally used for fibromyalgia because they tend not to decrease the specific pain of the condition. A special intravenous infusion called a Meyer’s cocktail has shown some promise in helping patients with their pain. It is a blend of several vitamins and nutrients that can correct imbalances in the body. Of course, the treatment for fibromyalgia doesn’t stop at medications. Pool therapy, physical therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, acupuncture, and chiropractic care are all viable adjuncts to medications, and your pain management physician can help you navigate your choices to select the treatment that is right for you.",

I have borderline personality disorder and was prescribed lamictal. I had been taking it for a month and then had my dose upped. A couple days after I noticed my thyroid gland was inflamed and swollen (no nodules or anything, just swollen gland) and I had cramping in my legs and tremors. I was instructed to go to medcheck and the dr there diagnosed me with some type of thyroid disorder from the lamictal and ordered blood tests. I was pretty sad because lamictal has worked so well for me. I am off of the lamictal for the time being but I’m hoping once this is sorted out I can go back on it. Anyways, I got my blood work done and so far I had received TSH and free T3 and they were normal. I also had free t4, tpo antibodies, thyroglobulin antibodies, reverse t3, rbc iodine levels and rbc magnesium levels tested. I have not received those results yet. The swelling has now created a lump in my throat/sore throat feeling and tonight I have developed thrush with sore gums which I have had many times before and I also have frequent yeast infections. What could possibly be causing my symptoms? If I receive my other tests and they are normal what else besides a thyroid issue be causing my symptoms?

I have always had issues with the Pain Management doctors I go to each month, they treat you like cattle rushing us thru to get to the next patient. My doctors office I go too saw the main Dr. on my first visit but then after that you see his PA or NP. They make us all sit in a room after being seen to wait for the main Dr. come sign the prescriptions so we can go. The main Dr. is busy in the back part of the building doing spinal injections and comes out in between patients to sign the prescriptions for us and they label that as being seen by the Dr. I have tried and tried to get out of that office before they kill me but no other,offices will let me move to them for some unknown reason. They state that after reviewing my records they would not be able to offer any me any other additional treatment than what I am currently receiving and deny my transfer. Once you are seen by a pain management facility in my area you can't stop and then go back again so I can't make my move that way or have my fibro dr refer me to a new facility so my hands are tied. I have to constantly remind them that I have fibro only to be told they don't treat fibro even though the dr told me they do twice. A couple months ago I went for my visit and out of the blue she dropped my dosage down and when I asked why she said I was taking a benzo and I couldn't take them together even though I have been taking the same mess for two years. She wrote in my chart that I got upset when my dosage was changed without saying I just wanted a explanation of why. I told her I had not been taking that benzo in months and even then it was as needed. I have never asked to be increased I just tell them how I feel and let them tell me what I need. The very next visit she asked me have you quit taking the benzo I tried to explain again but added that I flushed them. She then said that she was going to take me off my pain meds completely so I asked why. She said because I wasn't getting enough benefit out of it and then said you look the best I have ever seen you look and I said that is because I take the pain meds and that I was having a goo day.Geez! So now I worry each month when it's time for my next appt. what is going to happen and with the Gov. Big Opiod issue going on I just don't know what to do or what to expect.

So with this very long post I would like to know if anyone has info on what they are trying to do with the issue. It seems like they are trying to make it so expensive to have medication that we will have to go without it so then the opiod delima will be taken care of. MS Contin is non formulary on Medicare, maybe we have to decide each month which Rx to get filled. Will pain mgmt be nonexistent next year? If anyone read this whole thing I thank you and hope you have some info to pass along?

Eye Health,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/eye-health/3303/cataract-surgery,Cataract Surgery,"20 years ago I had 4 cut RK in both my eyes. I have been wearing glasses for the last 15 years. In September 2016 I started having issues where mid and distance vision deteriorated to the point that I had to look out of the bottom of my glasses to read highway signs. Vertical and horizontal lines had a slight shadow alongside the line. I had surgery to remove cataracts from both my eyes. At the consultation I was offered the opportunity to upgrade the lens implant to a bifocal lens or an accommodating lens. I was told that my distance vision would be corrected with any lens I chose. I was also informed that since my prior RK correction was minor, if I chose to upgrade to an accommodating lens that I may have an opportunity to correct for near, mid and far vision. The downside would be that I may require reading glasses. I chose to upgrade and pay a premium for an accommodating lens. My left eye was done first a TRULIGN IOL lens was prescribed prior to surgery. The morning of the surgery the surgeon said that he decided to implant a normal Crystal IOL lens and that if required he would complete a laser correction at a latter date. Two weeks later a Crystal IOL lens was implanted in my right eye. Both implants are: AT-50AO, Diopter 25.50, Optic Dia 5.0mm, Overall Dia 11.5mm. I am now experiencing vision issues for mid and distance vision. I can still distinguish a shadow on lines. Near vision is good.  My 2015 and 2016 vision prior to cataract surgery was: OD +1.25 +1.00 165 Add+2.50 OS +1.50 +1.00 179 Add+2.50 After surgery: OD -2.00 +1.75 178. Add+2.50 OS -1.75. +1.25 180 Add+2.50 The technician and optometrist that examined me after the surgery said that they can understand why I am concerned. My surgeon suggests that the outcome is within the acceptable range. The surgeon provided a prescription as noted above. It almost seems like they had in stock IOL's to use. I am not sure what to think and do not have access to experts like you. I would value your opinion.",

They had to keep upping my meds until I was at 2400 gabapentin and 50 amitriptyline.  I go through depression fatigue. I don't get sad, I just literally sleep as much as 22 hours a day. This happens 3-5 times a year and lasts a week or two. Then I also get episodes of insomnia at about the same frequency. In normal times have a hard time falling asleep, but also a hard time getting up. For the last like,.. 2 months straight I've been in a fatigue depression. I am literally sleeping my life away. Most days I get up for work. Sometimes I'm just toooo tired, even after 12 hours of sleep. I've also had a slow steady increase in aches and pains. I reached a point I was taking 800mg ibuprofen, and an Aleve several times a day too.  I told my doctor about my tiredness. He told me to quit the amitriptyline and see if that helps. I did. By the third day I was laying in a ball of pain. I started back up. Next visit I told his associate I had noticed how much pain the amitriptyline took away. She just upped it to 75 mg in hopes it would relieve more.  I also take vitamin d and b complex. My main doctor said there's no proof vitamins work, to save my money. But, I seem to think these two give me some energy.  I've also got this horrible sweet tooth and weight gain since I started these meds.

When they were finished, I still couldn't hear out of my left ear. They said to continue to flush it out and take an antibiotic. But I read where if you're hearing a ringing and popping you might have fluid built up...so I've been afraid to flush it, thinking I'd make it worse.

Then 3 weeks post-op the right eye began to be blurry at long distance. When the surgeon checked it he said my vision in that eye is now 2010 but that the fibromyalgia had pulled on the lens or in some way affected the positioning so that I lost my long-distance vision. He is not sure if it is correctable. Has anyone experienced this?

There's nothing more annoying than having bags under eyes and frustrated of not knowing how to fix the problem yourself.  1.Most of these problem comes from intake on high salty foods, which leads to fluid retention and causes results in eye bags in the morning. 2.Too much sun and smoking. These dries and weakens the skin on your face, causing eyes to wrinkle or sag.  3.When you sleep on your side or your stomach, it causes gravity that build fluids to collect under your eyes, which might explain those bags under the eyes. Here's your starting point on how to reverse your eye bags situation........ 1. Avoid or cut down your intake on high salty foods. Eat rich antioxidants foods like salmon fish, tomatoes, and fruits, such as berries and citrus. 2. Avoid too much sun exposure. Use sunglasses, sunscreen and hats to protect your face from harmful UV rays and stop smoking.  3. Change your sleep position, by sleeping on your back and add an extra pillow under your head, and use a moisturizing eye cream around your eyes, that have vitamins and nutrients.

Change your sleeping position by sleeping on your back. Also, use eye cream.  But you still need to know, when you drink too much alcohol and going to bed with your makeup on. You'll wake up with more eye puffiness.  Lessen the intake of alcohol. Drink water before you go to bed, wash off your makeup and use eye cream around and under your eyes.  If you want the best way, is to break free, from all other cycles that causes eyebags, wrinkles and puffiness..... Consider the eye cream instantly right now, to get rid of bags under your eyes.",

I had what I like to call the Christmas tree effect going on in my body. Whenever the barometric pressure had a significant change, say a Hurricane was getting ready to form in the Gulf of Mexico. Then crash into another Hurricane brewing in the Atlantic off the Coast of GA. I knew something big was coming before the weather man said a word. My body flipped those rotating Christmas lights on, as if the darn Elf on the shelf had them on turbo. My pain would jump from one spot to the other. Then to kick it up a notch. It would feel like lightening bolts were shooting out of my toes. Initially when this all started, I thought the ground wire for our house had an issue. But that was immediately checked off the list, because I was the only person with the problem. At first I thought it was all in my head, and simply wouldn't acknowledge the pain. I've had one back surgery. I have no hardware as I was very clear with the first surgeon. Get it done on this go around. I'm only doing this one time. I've done PT along with water therapy. For me, my problem is I have a crazy high threshold for pain. With the additional issue that no form of pain medication has been able to ease the pain period. I have pain everyday all day. So, I simply don't take real pain medication. Morphine has zero effect on me. None. The others upset my stomach so bad, I'd rather be in pain. So, what can you do for pain? If you stay in bed all day, that makes your pain go through the roof. If you sit all day, the same problem. Walking and standing in place also cause an issue. So you have to find a balance. When my pain is so bad I don't think I can handle it one more minute. I clean and do laundry. For me, movement helps ease the pain. Keeping blood moving to all the injured parts of the body helps. Along with hot showers or baths. Heating pads. Etc. Mix it up. Going to a Pain Psychologist also helped. I'm able to mind over matter my pain. It takes patience and practice. But it can be done. I've been dealing with my back issue for almost 20 years. I've had my amazing Pain Management Doctor for 13 years. It's hard to give control to your doctor. I was really stubborn at first. Then I began to trust my her. She has helped me so much over these 13 years. You have to be willing to try different forms of treatment. I've been willing to do everything to easy my pain. Except take any medication that has Oxy in it or cotin as the end. I've never had the meds and never will. Some form of movement and a positive mental attitude also helps. Never ever give up. Do not let this disease win. Try and enjoy some of hobbies you enjoyed before you got kicked by this nasty little donkey.",

I unfortunately do not own a thermometer so I cannot factually say that I had a fever or guess how hot I was/am. This generally starts once I wake up and goes on for around 3 hours.

It started with sudden anxiety attacks and elevated stress, even though I've never had any symptoms of that before. Now, I'm no longer suffering from anxiety or stress, but I'm still having symptoms. I have very mild chest pains from time to time, I've been having a pulsing or beating feeling in certain parts of my body, and very recently I've starting having small muscle twitches. Especially when I'm sitting or lying down, my legs and sometimes my shoulders will twitch or even lightly shake. I was wondering if anyone who suffers fibromyalgia goes through this type of thing, if maybe that's what I have. Other things to note are that a couple of weeks ago, I went through a pretty drastic weight change, going from 120 pounds to 115 pounds in just a few days. I'm now back up at my original weight, but I thought maybe the weight loss might have had something to do with the twitching or weak legs. I've seen my doctor about the weight loss and we did blood tests that ruled out diabetes and hyperthyroidism as causes, so I was wondering if maybe fibromyalgia could be a possible cause.",Symptoms

One day my inner right ear started to itch really bad, i could feel all the way down to my throat whenever i swallowed. It went away for a couple of weeks but then started again, after the summer. I have visited 3 or 4 different ear nose and throat doctors, including an allergist, and none of them could find anything, they all checked inside my ear, double checked. Their answer was the same, ""I don't see anything wrong with your ear"", so when i visited the 4th and final doctor, he told me that he strongly believes it's anxiety and that i should just try to stop reacting to it, the truth is i did have some anxiety issues before all that, but they were gone. I took his advice and somehow, after a few days of not paying any attention to it, it went away. Now it's returned, and i really don't think it's anxiety, started a few days ago, during the day, tried to ignore it, until yesterday. It woke me up in the middle of the night, that's never happened to me before, i woke up because of the itching, it was so bad, like i said it starts inside my right ear all the way down to my rightmost throat and i feel hopeless because there's nothing i can do about it, it's worse than any other time, i'm afraid doctors will start ignoring me and blame it on anxiety again.

Or something else?,"Hello, I need help getting to the bottom of things and all four doctors claim I'm depressed yet I don't express a single sign of depression nor am I unhappy in such a way. I'm a 23 year old man, have previously smoked tobacco but quit. I do not take any medications. I got an influenza at the end of 2015 with recurring infections after that for a while, then I never got back to normal. I remember the aches I got from that first influenza (not actually confirmed by a doctor but could have been), the aches manifested mostly in the shoulder blades and shoulders and very slightly in upper arms and upper lower legs. This pain I've had ever since then and it's been less severe at times and more severe at times, it varies a lot, it's also accompanied by fatigue that also varies in severity. Sometimes the fatigue lasts for weeks of me feeling like sitting up is too hard sometimes because of the tiredness and sometimes it's only moderate but still feeling too tired to do any activities often. I have not noticed any improvement with excersize.  On top of this when it gets to be as worst I also experience what I've referred to as ""episodes"" in where I experience STRONG fatigue out of nowhere when I'm sitting up or doing something to the point that I have to lay down. At this point I often check my heart rate because it feels elevated because I somewhat feel my pulse throughout my body and it's often around 85-90. My resting heart rate has been known to be between 55-65 otherwise, during these episodes I may experience a moderate tingling sensations in hands and lower legs and feet and I feel like I am too tired to keep my eyes open, this lasts often for an hour and then goes away slowly as I feel the tingling feeling leaving slowly. Very weird and when it happens it tends to happen faulty for a few days and then disappear for a week or a few, only the episode part that is. Doctors claim I cannot have fibromyalgia because I don't have the so called tender spots and because it comes and goes, to me this appears to be bogus. I can feel pain around my shoulder blade areas when pressing a bit hard. Not sure if that's normal. I've also regularly had apparently SLIGHTLY elevated TSH on many occasions however always with perfectly normal T3 and T4.  I did suspect Polymyalgia rheumatica for a while but I'm no doctor and know nothing.","Symptoms , Diagnosis"

I come along to wash my hands with soap and water in a sink [that also has dirty dishes in it] and water on the faucet handle and then I turn off the faucet. Immediately after, while at the sink, I use a finger to extract an eye booger from the inner corner of my eye. Can I get eye herpes from this given the time frame and circumstance (wet faucet handle/soiled dishes that might have splattered)? The person I live with has oral and eye herpes. His first episode was after visiting a dentist many years ago and was confirmed as herpes by a doctor. He has a bad immune system and is older so he often has breakouts and generally always has some kinds of sores on his face. I've read multiple things about how long it can live outside of the body and cause transmission. One is that herpes cannot live on dead surfaces for more than 10 seconds, but I've also read it can live on non porous solid objects for 4-8 hours (like a faucet) and wet cloth for 2-4 hours and dry cloth for 15 minutes. Not sure what to go by and what my risk is considering it was a wet solid object and I immediately stuck my finger in my eye but it was an hour after the sink was last used. I don't want to make him feel bad about it so I don't bring it up but I'm crashing here for a little bit and when things like this occur I worry about transmission. It's not usually the first thing on my mind though so I do things like shut off the faucet and then rub my eyes thinking, 'oh, i just washed my hands so they're clean and I can clean my eyes,' and then start to worry ten minutes later realizing I didn't do the most sanitary thing and could have exposed myself to it.

Between then and now I have had ETD flare ups almost every year, some lasting several weeks, some lasting over 6 months. In fact, my ears are never 100% fixed; 90% maybe, but i always have mild symptoms that don't affect my daily life too much, until i have another flare up and then it is debilitating. I feel nauseated, (have vomited on the rare occasions when it has been very bad), feel off-balance, feel like i am constantly going up and down like on a boat, feel sudden rushes like i am falling (this disturbs my sleep), have brain fog, fatigue, feel very anxious and on the verge of tears. All those symptoms subside when the pressure in my ears subsides. The doctors do nothing except give me steroid nasal spray and say to wait it out, but the spray does nothing even when taken for months, and i have etd so often that i spend 6 months at a time debilitated by it. It is not just a bit of ear pressure and hearing noises. I have noticed that my monthly cycle affects it too, symptoms being worse before my period starts. I have read online that hormones can affect the eustachian tube, and am wondering if it is possible that a hormonal imbalance is the cause of these reoccurring and chronic etd problems? I have also read that thyroid disorders can cause etd but this is little known. I do not seem to have other symptoms of thyroid issues nor hormonal imbalance but has anyone else noticed a connection? I have not had my blood tested for such things and am not sure an nhs dr would even consider the possibility. I know that allergies can be a cause but i begin suffering in the winter months, not spring or summer, and do not have a blocked nose or watery eyes. Would it be worth asking a dr to be tested for allergies?  Also, has anyone found coping mechanisms for the emotional symptoms etd can cause? Would anxiety meds help? I am not sure if they would since the anxiety is directly associated with the ear pressure and movement symptoms.  Any help would be much appreciated. I would really like to find a cause for this since it happens so frequently. I cannot find a reason for the flare ups, i do not have a cold before it starts. The first time i had etd it began with a virus, and perhaps it has damaged the eustachian tubes. But it would be nice to figure out what starts the flare ups.",Ear Problems

Hello I am a F 26YO. I have suffered from severe lack of breath for about 13months now. It started when I was pregnant and I am not 6m post partum and still struggling.  I have severe shortness of breath and irregular breathing for about 80% (sometimes more, sometimes less) of my waking day. Sometimes I breath in so deep and so hard that my ears pop and unpop, and I can continue in that state for an hour or more trying to regulate my breathing and unpop my ears permanently. Sometimes my breathing is so messed a whole hand or side of my body will go numb like I’m having a stroke. Sometimes my chest gets very tight and I feel I really won’t be able to catch my breath. I often think I’m going to pass out or choke but I never do. When I was pregnant it manifested itself as a dry cough which I had for 6m straight, literally from lack of breath. It affects my life as I can be rude or snappy to people when I’m trying to regulate my breathing, and I’m often not present in what’s going on. Plus all the hard deep breathing is causing pain in my back. I have been to three different doctors and all of them have diagnosed anxiety (something I have struggled with in different forms for 11years). They think it’s this because i seem to be fine when I sleep and for the first 10 minutes when I wake from sleeping, and if I am very preoccupied (in some situations). I have been diagnosed escitocitalopram 20mg for the anxiety. I’ve been on it for around 10 months (or longer) with no success. In my country you only qualify for free/subsidised non-medical counselling help if you are depressed and on the verge of suicide. Other than my days being hard work because I can’t breathe I have a happy life and am not depressed hence why I cannot get counselling.

Fibromyalgia,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/fibromyalgia/7871/diagnosed-with-fibro-two-months-ago,DIagnosed with Fibro Two Months Ago,"Hi, I am new here and this is my first post and not sure where to begin, so here goes. Over the last year I have had chronic pain from the shoulders down to my toes. In the beginning I didn't worry too much about it as I had started a new job and thought my body just needed time to adjust.  A little about me first I guess. I am a 53 year old female, a little on the heavy side but have been losing weight on my own, but could stand a little more. I have always worked a physical job, for over 20 years I worked as a CNA in the hospital, so that involves a lot of lifting, etc. I have also worked retail over the years and for the last year and a half that is my current job. When the pain began early last year, I just assumed it was getting use to standing/walking on concrete floors all day and lifting a lot of heavy boxes though out my shift. Well over time the pain has only gotten worse and after talking to my NP about it over many months, she did the tender point test on a very bad day, to the point I told her to quit touching me because I was hurting so bad. So, I was diagnosed with Fibro a few months ago.  Due to my health seeming to get worse from the pain and not getting any sleep because of it, my NP put me on Elavil starting me at a low dose and I am now built up from 10mg to 30mg at bedtime. I also take Alka Seltzer for pain and at one point was taking so much, my body was full of bruises from so much aspirin. I was told to cut it back to no more than 2 times a day as I had been taking it 4 to 5 times a day. She had put me on Gabapentin to help with the pain and after 2 months I quit taking them because they did not help at all. So, I am just taking the Elavil and Alka Seltzer for pain. The aspirin seems to take the edge of the pain off but not take the pain all away.  I also have arthritis in my knee joints and I know that isn't helping. I have also noticed over the last 5-6 months that if I sit in one spot too long and get up that my left leg does not want to go. My mind is telling it what to do, but being able to put pressure on it because of the pain and lack of strength in it, it takes me a few minutes sometimes to get it going.  One of my concerns is, is this really Fibro? It seems that the pain is never completely gone, my level at its best is usually a 2 and at its worst a 10+. Over the last 2 weeks with today being one of those days, I was actually feeling good or so I thought and my pain suddenly jumped from about a 2 to a 10+, no warning, just boom!!! I was all but in tears but was at work working the register and had to continue to manage a smile and be pleasant as the Assist Manager was on break. As soon as she came back she noticed a change in my behavior and asked what was wrong and I told her that suddenly the pain became almost unbearable. I went and sat in the office and cried for 5 minutes because of the pain. One night last week when I got home from work the pain was just as bad and I almost drove myself to the ER to see if they had any better answers than Fibro being the issue. But it was the fear of maybe being kept there that kept me from going. I was eventually able to sleep and woke the next morning with my pain being about a 5-6.  My NP says with taking the Elavil, I should not be having this much pain. So I was wondering if others may have experienced the same things as I have shared here? Thoughts appreciated.","Symptoms , Diagnosis"

 in need of answers :(","Here's a little Journey of my health over the past couple months. I'm at my wits end! I don't know what to do, I'm only a 19 year old female. Any advice or comments, suggestions, inferences or hypotheses as to what could possibly be going on with me would greatly appreciated. (writing this with shaky hands), here's a little in sight of what's been going on/ when it started and the symptoms i've been experiencing. I've wrote down the dates from day 1 to present (which might be a little off) *Prior to the first date i've listed below, I was experiencing other symptoms over the course of a month but gradually. Fatigue, feeling like I was in a fog most of the time, trouble remembering things, concentrating, just didn't feel all there. I noticed my right eye felt as if it wasn't as strong as my right one (blurriness). My right ear also felt plugged all the time followed by a pain on the right side of my face that was connected from my ear to my jaw that lasted a little more than a month but has now subsided. Things such as clumsiness, tingling in my hands and feet and weakness were also experienced. *May 27th 2017* Was when I first went to the ER for an excruciating headache, I was given an IV + headache medication, I felt this feeling of general discomfort throughout my body as the medication was going through the IV to my arm (have not felt the same since, it was like an irritable feeling that I still sometimes experience.) A few days after that I began to feel very shaky and just not okay. Was still having problems with my right eye, was also continuing to suffer from the intense headache listed above but it was now causing a burning sensation in different areas of my head and the back of my neck. This headache and feeling of pressure/ burning sensations continued on for about a week or so.  *June 3rd* was STILL experiencing this same headache/pressure and burning sensation, so I went back to the ER. After waiting for 4hrs+ at the ER just to see the doctor, he examined me and didn’t think anything too serious of the headache suggesting a possible sinus infection. I told him I didn’t think it was just a sinus infection after mentioning a history of brain tumour in my family, I asked for a CT scan of my head just to make sure. Hesitant to give me the CT scan because of his doubt that there was anything seriously wrong (such as a brain tumor) he prescribed me sinus infection medication and sent me on my way. *June 7th Went back to the ER with the same severe persistent headache and burning sensations throughout my head and neck along with a few new symptoms that presented themselves such as weakness as well as a burning sensation on the top of my legs. I was seen by a different doctor this time, who thought a CT scan was in my best interest. I agreed to the CT scan of the brain which came back as in fact sinus inflammation in the brain. I was given RAN- CLARITHROMYCIN 500MG & PMS-DEXAMETHASONE 4 MG. Although a sinus infection was the only thing to come of the CT scan, the symptoms I had been experiencing and explained to the doctor earlier ex. burning in my neck and head, trouble with my right eye, intense migraines, clumsiness, cognitive issues (poor memory, unable to concentrate) ""brain fog"", muscle weakness, suggested him to believe it could be something more, he mentioned a possibility of MS and told me he was going to order an MRI of my brain to rule it out.  *After taking the medication for the sinus infection the headaches did stop*. From June 7th - 16th awaiting the MRI of my brain the doctor from the ER had ordered I was very stressed and depressed about thinking MS was what was causing all these symptoms. I was under extreme amounts of stress. At this time I started noticing the fatigue becoming worse where I would just have to lay down due to feeling very weak and physically exhausted. Also at this time I noticed I was having sleep troubles. I would have a hard time falling asleep even to just nap even though my body was so tired, my brain would just not allow me to sleep. At night time especially I would also have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep as I would wake up every couple hours. I also noticed I'd developed a slight tremor in my right hand/arm whenever I would lay down. The tremor was not as noticeable to the naked eye as it was within my body, it would keep me awake as well due to just being uncomfortable. Within the next two weeks of experiencing these symptoms I also noticed a decrease in my weight. I lost a total of 14 pounds unintentionally, but possibly due to extreme stress.  *June 17th I had the MRI of my head. The tremor in my hand/arm got slightly worse as you could now see a slight shake with the naked eye, I also noticed my legs would twitch while laying down and feel as if they had a slight vibration to them coming from the inside. *June 19th exhausted from only getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep a night accompanied by the weakness in my body and tremor, I also noticed an irritable feeling in my upper back from time to time making it very uncomfortable to lay down or to sit for long periods. It felt almost as if I had restless back syndrome that persisted throughout the day and the night. Sometimes this feeling would go into my arms, as well as the burning sensations on the top of my legs continuing to persist. *June 22 Was my appointment with the neurologist to discuss my prior MRI scan of my brain to see if MS was the reason behind these symptoms or not. I and was told by the neurologist my brain scan was clear having no lesions, and that MS was ruled out. After explaining to the neurologist my still existing symptoms they did a physical neurological exam confirming it was still not MS. They then suggested an anti anxiety medication. I had an appointment with my family doctor that following day, and explained the persisting symptoms I was still having. My doctor also related it back to anxiety and prescribed me with an antidepressant/anti anxiety medication which I have not taken because I do not agree that these symptoms are from anxiety. As well as ordering more blood work, checking levels, deficiencies and ruling out any other scary things such as Lymes, Lupus, RA, & crohn's disease. *All blood work has came back normal, and negative for any autoimmune/rheumatic diseases*.  A few weeks later with still no answers and the same persisting symptoms, along with some new ones that are becoming quite concerning. I’m now experiencing widespread pain throughout my body. These pains come and go hitting my body in different areas giving me extreme muscle pain mainly in my back, forearms, shoulders, hips, knees and buttocks. The pain intensifies in different areas, the other day I woke up with my upper back aching for hours and then it would move down to my lower back. Then the next day my back wouldn't hurt any more but my left forearm would be in excruciating muscle pain as if I'd just exercised heavily the day before (which I did not). Other extremities such as my ankles, hands, feet, toes and fingers would just ache,pain and almost feel like little electric shocks(mainly in fingers and toes), throughout the day accompanied by the burning sensation. I am still not able to fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night. I’ve woken up overheating and sweating, not being able to swallow. A rash that appeared out of nowhere on my neck (went away after an hour) along with a very flushed face. Restless back and leg pain (in the day and at night). At this point I just don’t know what to do!! I’m out of answers, very frustrated and in pain :( if anyone has anything similar experiences that followed by a diagnoses or any idea of what this may be let me know!!","Symptoms , Diagnosis"

"Ear, Nose & Throat",https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/38089/hearing-loss,Hearing loss,"Hello, English is not my first language so please bear with me. Ever since my childhood about 8yo I was having ""middle ear infections"" ? in English I think it is called Otitis media?. It started usually at night, the pain was intolerable so my mom would take me to the emergency room where they always punctured/pierced my ear drum. The procedure was very painful but it relieved the pain almost immediately.  This was recurring at least once a year until I was about 14yo. At that age, I started to experience hearing loss. I went to see a doctor but after checking my ear he told me that everything looks fine. So I just continued with my life until the hearing loss became so severe that I couldn't even hear the teachers at school. I went back to the doctor explaining my situation. After looking in my ear again he apologized for not noticing it the last time and told me I have a different kind of infection ""infection of sekrets"" ?sinusitis? and recommended me to an ear specialist supposedly top of his field. The new doctor confirmed the diagnose and scheduled me for a procedure/surgery where I laid down the nurse would hold my head very tight to avoid any movement and the doctor would again pierce my ear drum but this time left the needle there and connected something like a vacuum cleaner to it and sucked the ?puss? out and inserted gromets ?myringotomy?. This was even more painful than the previous procedures and left me very light headed after. However, my hearing went back to normal immediately after. This again recurred at least once a year for both ears. About 3 years ago when I was 24 I asked him if the condition is ever going to go away or if I'll have to undergo this procedure yearly all my life. He sent me to get a CT scan and after the result came told me I have some ""dead tissue"" in my head/ear and recommended a surgery. When I asked him what the surgery was he explained that they would have to cut a little triangle out of my skull behind my ear end insert tubes that would stick out of my head for about 3 weeks during which I would have to stay in the hospital. He also told me that the procedure is extremely painful and that there is no guarantee it will help. Also, the side effects were very scary like loss of taste, paralysis and even death. So I declined the surgery and started looking for a new specialist. I then found a private clinic (very expensive) with hitec equipment. The doctor there found that my ""nose tonsils"" ?adenoids? are severely overgrown and that they are pressing against my eustachian tube, therefore, preventing drainage. So he scheduled me for a surgery to remove the ?adenoids? and also ?myringotomy?. This time everything was done with lasers and I was under anesthesia. It has been about 2 years since the surgery and it all looked fine until about a month ago when I started to notice that I'm starting to lose hearing in my left ear again but it doesn't come close to what it used to be.  I have been living in California for the past 18 months and currently don't have health insurance because I can't afford it yet but will get it soon. (btw several doctors recommended that it would help to move to a warm/tropical country) So my question is what kind of procedures would American medicine recommend? Cost? If I grew up here would the doctors here proceed the same way or do something differently? P.S. I apologize for the long post but I wanted to include as much info as possible.",Ear Problems

For the last one month, the pain has started to happen more often. For the last couple of weeks, I have been having this pain at least once a day although it is less intense for most of the times. My doctor said it is nothing to worry about and hasn't prescribed any medication. However, I am worried with the frequency and if he is overlooking something. I am looking to understand if this is common for others too and if there is something I need to worry about.",

I called in sick today, because I could not sleep last night from my anxiety and pain. I'm afraid to ask for time off from work to see a doctor, since I'm still new at my job.

About 5 years ago or so I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, to be entirely honest I've read up on it and stories from other people and I'm not sure if that's what I have. Since I was -3- years old, I have gotten pains in my legs that would cause me to cry until my father or mother would massage them in the middle of the night until the pain went away. (Doctors said it was ""growing pains"" and that they would go away by the time I was 12.) Around the time I hit 8/9 years old, I began to develop the pain in my feet as well and I learned to somehow cope with the pain by locking my self in the bathroom crying and squeezing my leg to compress the pains. By the time I was 12, I had begun to develop the pain in my arms, hands, knees, shins, forearms, feet, toes & fingers, and occasionally my shoulders. My pains were beginning to worsen and I would cry at night and just take the chew able Tylenol tablets my parents would give me. I am not 21, I still get pains all throughout my bones/body, not JUST joints. I have managed to have a high pain tolerance because of these pains and can feel the pains coming about 20 minutes before they start hurting bad in this case I will take Aleve (Naproxen) to soothe my pains.  Whenever I feel the pains coming or if they are already active I notice that whatever area is affected becomes very cold like ice. For example today I am wearing jeans and long boots, and I am inside however my one of my knees is freezing cold, I can run my hand up to the higher part of my leg and its warm like the rest of my body. Now that I'm older, it happens at all times of the day & night just about every other day. I have had blood drawn numerous times throughout my life but after they said it was Fibromyalgia I gave up, they are sending me to pointless specialists and making me spend unnecessary money. I figured SOMEBODY has to be having the same issue right? Please help..im in pain.","Living With , Symptoms , Diagnosis"

A couple months ago in his left ear only, a sound started up that he describes as like a bass guitar playing a ""riff"" in a random pattern and the sequence is not repeated. He can stop the sound by either putting a finger in his ear or closing off the ear with the outer edge of the ear. The ENT he went to had never encountered this before, had no answers, but did prescribe a steroid 6-pack called ""Medrol"". that did stop it from recurring for 17 days before it came back. The ENT also had him get a MRI of the brain area and a second one with contrast. Both results were completely normal. So the ENT thinks the cause of this is viral or allergenic, or both. A second 6-pack of Medrol has also stopped it for the moment. The ENT thought it was possibly ""Miniere's Disease"", but my friend has none of the listed symptoms for Miniere's Disease. 1. No sign of vertigo 2. No ringing in the ear a la tinnitus 3. No hearing loss When this 'bass guitar' starts ""playing"", it has mainly lasted from around 6 to 9 hours, and once almost 24 hours.

I have tried to find support groups in my area through doctors, but haven't had any luck with fibro-specific groups. I think this illness comes with such specific symptoms that I didn't feel right participating in groups dealing with all chronic illnesses.  I started developing FM symptoms at age 10 and was diagnosed at age 15. Similar to most of you, that was a grueling 5 years of MD visits. I felt crazy by the end. A lot of doctors tried to convince my mom that I was making it up, but I was lucky in that she advocated for me.  I ended up being diagnosed by a pediatric rheumatologist, who tested my pressure points (ouch), listened to my symptoms and diagnosed me in about 15 seconds. He said ""Well, the good news is I know what you have. The bad news is there's really nothing I can do about it."" Sound familiar? Since that time I have been dealing with intense fibro fog and exhaustion. Over time the pain all over my body has increased and I pretty much feel like I have a low-grade fever 24/7 (of course the thermometer disagrees). I am 27 now - overall doing well with symptom management but it's been a really hard road. I am in graduate school and will graduate in May. I am really anxious about re-entering the workforce. My exhaustion, pain and need for naps has gotten in the way of work historically. I'm looking for a community where I can read about how others engage in self care and work to feel better. Also wondering if others experience heightened emotional sensitivity/empathy towards others in addition to heightened sensory pain?

I work in the cold, and we park in a garage that you can taste the dust on your tongue. Not great. I recently got the flu and developed a cough. It was dry for awhile, but I was prescribed prednisone and I have been taking mucinex with it to break it up. I had already taken off a week of work from the flu and couldn’t afford to do another week, so I had to ask for the steroids. The past two days have been the worst with me picking up slack working by myself and 20+ hours. So far the medication has been working, however I feel like it’s a never ending need to cough. Before the steroid and after, I’ve had clear/white phlegm. Very thin, and feels like I didn’t get anything. However when I get big chunks they’re gray/black or brown. Cough is productive since medication, but I have a pain in my right chest under the nipple and the lateral chest when I breathe or cough so I feel I cannot cough fully. I looked up meanings of phlegm color and the only thing with white, black, and brown is pneumoconiosis. My gf is a nursing student, and listened to my airways and thinks I need bronchial dilation. That correlates with pneumoconiosis. My Dr’s nurse said my chest pain muscle spasms, but it feels in between the rib cage which would be arthritic. My family has a history of arthritis and I currently am undiagnosed but have chronic pain. Pneumoconiosis and arthritis lead to Caplan’s syndrome. Both are non curable and grounds for a lawsuit.

It's on both sides in the the same area but it hurts worse on the left side. My face is literally swollen, but I seem to be the only one who notices, but I can definitely tell, my parents don't see it but I think it's just because it's slowly swelled over such a long period of time. I can't even begin to describe how uncomfortable it is, it even affects my jaw movement and my jaw muscles also It's also made my jawline swell, so it looks like I almost don't have a jawline, which I definitely did before, and its not because ive gained weight, ive actually lost weight. Whatever this condition is it has ruined my life. I don't really have dry mouth or any discharge into my mouth. It honestly feels like they are lymph nodes or something. And right next to my lips like an inch away you can see my pulse, it's like my lips are swollen too, like not my lips per se but the area around my lips. I've been to like 4 different doctors..none of them believe me or anything,they all just think I have a fat face and it's in my head...like wtf, the pain is not in my head, neither are the lumps that are palpable, none of the doctors actually feel for them, because they don't believe a condition like this exists. I've been to an ent and she sent me in for a biopsy because a ton of my submandibular lymph nodes are swollen. But it came back as reactive? So she's just given up...I have no quality of life anymore, I just stay in because smiling or moving my face at all is super painful. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. I've lost all my friends because no one understands...heck I don't understand! The ent wouldn't even feel my cheeks for the lumps that I'm talking about, all of the doctors I've been to have been clueless about this. I had a ct scan done and it didn't show anything but it has to be wrong because the lumps are palpably swollen. It doesn't hurt worse when I suck on lemon candy or sour foods. I just don't know what to do. I'm going to get a few minor cavities filled in hopes that that will cure this. But none of my teeth hurt, and I really doubt it's that. The pain is so bad I've thought of suicide. The doctors refuse to treat my pain even when I'm sitting there telling them it hurts so bad I've thought of suicide. I feel like the medical system has given up on me. It really sucks because I'm only 18 and I feel like my life has been ruined by this. Im just so tired of this.

It happens every day, and typically lasts between 5 minutes and sometime up to an hour. The volume she spits up can sometimes be as much as half a cup. It is very red and liquidy and is definitely blood (its been tested). She has had extensive workups at 2 leading hospitals that has included: multiple overnight admits; tons of lab work (all fine), an angiogram (all fine), 2 ENT scopes, dentist (all fine); consults with a multi-disciplined team (ENT, gastro, pulmonary, neurology, hematology, etc.) They appear to have ruled out soooo many things, but the daily spitting up of bloody saliva continues despite all of this. Her ENT recently even cauterized some suspect blood vessels (talangatasias, sp?) in her throat thinking they might be the source. Even thought she might have HTT, which was ruled out via labs.  Her labs are all good, never any temps, eats great, sleeps great, well-adjusted girl otherwise. Never any blood in stool and does not appear to be coming from stomach (never resembles ground coffee , and is not acidic at all per lab testing). She's been tested for so much, and so much has been ruled out, but the daily bouts of spitting up the blood continue. Not a ton of blood in the spit up as she never gets anemic. Also, there is never a cough associated with this, and her lungs are clear as a bell. All the leading docs are saying is that they can take another look via scope to see if they missed anything.  To find the source of the blood and end this is the goal. We are not sure where to go next. Any insight would be much appreciated!",

Fibromyalgia,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/fibromyalgia/2244/nearly-painless-fm,Nearly Painless FM??,"Maybe about 25 years ago I was diagnosed with FM. The rheumatologist spent less than ten minutes with me and never asked about pain. He pinched my joints and said I had it and gave me a pamphlet which explained pain as the main symptom, just as everything I've read before and since says. I never followed through on it because my primary complaint is chronic intermittent fatigue... meaning I go through l long periods where I am always overtired, tired to the bone, is my usual description. And there were other reasons I didn't feel the doctor was a good match for me.  There are also times when I wake up not tired. Those times used to last longer than they do now. I'm not without pain, but 99% of the time it is logical. With the fatigue it seems that the closest I usually have of pain is a tired achyness like you might get doing some heavy labor, except I often wake up feeling it. Other times it unexpectedly wallops me. Other times I am just extremely fatigued with no pain or ache.  More recently I was diagnosed with sleep apnea. I'm very good about keeping my mask on all night and at first it seemed to help, but the fatigue didn't go away, just the tiredness -- ie. I'm not always sleepy, but just worn out tired for no reason So what I'm asking is does this actually seem like fibromyagia or it it ""just"" some form of cfs that my doctors can't or won't label as such. I don't care about labels, but maybe if this seems more like fm than cfs or ""unknown"", there may be different things to do to cope with it. Right now the only thing that helps is exercise (walking), but it doesn't always help. Sometimes it just wears me out more, even though I love walking. I used to walk for 2 or 3 hours at a time with no problem, and I'd like to get back to being able to walk at least 30 to 60 minutes five days a week, without feeling like I marched all day without stopping.",Symptoms

I am also bipolar. I have IBS, arthritis, ... When one disorder is 'acting up,' they all are. I no longer think about ""do I also have..."" Instead, to my way of thinking, they are all responses to a common malady.  The #1 trigger for me, historically, has been poor sleep. I have found a medicine that has helped a great deal with the sleep problem and my fibromyalgia, et. al., episodes are less frequent. However, something else that has helped is adopting a diet change that is geared to address all auto-immune disorders. The almost immediate improvement in my symptoms (and in other factors I did not anticipate) was dramatic. Now, having gone off...then on...then off...and back on the diet, during the holidays, I have been able to observe the effects of the diet on my overall health.  I have lost a lot of bloating (that I thought was fat/excess weight); I sleep a full night; I am less reactive mood-wise; my pain is less and the amount of time spent in pain is less. Diet is only one aspect of a functional medicine approach and the only one I have addressed so far. The diet I am following starts with no dairy, no gluten, no eggs.

I believe I have had symptoms for 20 years. I got to be in so much pain after the last 10 or so. I was diagnosed quickly by a very good and intuitive doctor. I was given Vicodin in addition to meds I was already on. Right now I'm on flexeril, Prozac, Clonazapin and other unrelated medications. I was sent to a Rheumatologist he also diagnosed fibromyalgia. I was give up to 4 Vicodin a day. I moved twice since diagnosis and 4 additional doctors agreed.  I am now experiencing the worse flare I could imagine. I the mean time I have had injections in my lower back and shoulder. And they do work temporarily just like they do in any person with any ailment. So do not believe anyone who says otherwise. I had them but have not really needed them until now. I had injections in to my spinal cord guided by ultrasound I think.  I am a licensed funeral director and embalmer. I was the first woman funeral director in my county to become licensed. I had to do everything the men did and I knew I would have to prove myself. And I did lifted, embalmed, made removals etc. I was on call all the time. We used pagers then. I have been licensed 25 years. I am 55 years old. I know I may have damaged my back because of my job , but I have pain everywhere.  I went to mortuary science as though it was a calling. Not just a job. I did everything and more because I loved it. Truly loved every part of it. In my state you must mold a Bachelors Degree in order to be licensed. You must take a national testing exam and 2 other state exam and do a one year apprenticeship before getta license. I weighed about 100 lbs at the time but I did everything the guys did. It was funny to me that people would ask if I liked being a mortician. Who would go through all that and not love it?  I worked a long time with fibro until I just couldn't do it anymore. Even learning the new computer systems confused me. I was the one in the funeral home to go to out of state training for computer training and train the funeral directors at our funeral home and others. Now. I can do none of it. Can't stay on feet too long. Hands hurt and cramp. I drop things. I am clumsy. Extra sensitive to cold so taking out a winter funeral was actually painful. I could not do all the things I used to... And in funeral service if you can not do everything you don't keep your job if you can only accomplish 1 or 2 tasks. Well 2 years ago I quit working. Not by choice... The pain was getting so bad. Even with injections and all they can not nor will they give you injections all over you body. My hands, feet, back, hips,neck hurt everyday in some way. Do not even ask about sexual problems but my husband is not one that deserves this missing part of our lives. Some days worse than others just like you describe in your posts. But I will not give up.  I can not work and they do not think I need disability. So the profession I so loved is gone to me.  Do not let any doctors, nurses, rheumatologist or neurologist tell it doesn't get worse. My symptoms were progressing while I was still working. And I do believe they may get worse or out or control after a tragedy.  My oldest son was suffering from a disease that required a kidney transplant. At first he was not diagnosed and he was seeing a doctor who gave him OxyContin for years. After a couple suicide attempts I took him to the clinic. Needless to say the doctor fled the country and my son was hopelessly addicted to opiates.  We tried to tell everyone before surgery and after that he was narcotic intolerant. After surgery he was in so much pain I had to cry, Yell and to them over and over. Drew's surgery was a partial success but he still had a lot of pain and because I could not be sure the pain was real and and he was in detox several times I did not take him back to Cleveland Clinic. I am guilty of that. Meanwhile Drew fathered a beautiful little girl. They never married but she became a huge part of his life and ours.  Drew was a father to this beautiful girl. Unfortunately she lost her daddy to suicide when she was five.  I know all about grief. The normal and not normal and I thought I was doing ok. It took a time to even be ok I cry for him every night.  I now know that my symptoms of fibromyalgia were getting worse after his death. A bit at a time and just 2 years after his death am in more pain than ever. Am I having a flare or will I be like this the rest of my life? I can not work, I can't do housework, I can't do much of anything. I still do housework and indoor and outdoor gardening. Well I can't do it really without severe pain. But I will not have everything taken from me  Will I have to live my life like this. When I'll be able to do anything?? That is what concerns me most. I have a wonderful husband...but who would want to retire in 10 years to this? I have another son. He was born 16 months from Drew and is coping as well as he can. He was doing drugs and is in recovery. But went through so much to get him where he is no.  I want to be with with Drew and my mom and my sisters who are with him now... But I can not and will not. I have to many people to take care of. My dad lives with us. It's been 2 years he's been here and he has severe back pain and is being treated by the clinic. I take him where he needs to go as well. My mom died one year ago September. So of course I grieve her as well. She was my go to. Because those of us who have lost children have no names to describe us.  I was doing a funeral with a clergy member wo had lost one of his twin sons in a house fire. We were discussing that there is no name because it would be a very ugly name. Then he said to me "" yo know what we are ? We are screwed. With each new trial with my loved ones will I continue to get worse? Or more cramps and more pain and fatigue and scrambled egg brain going to get worse ? Or is this just a flare up ? My symptoms have got nothing but worse. I can't even blow dry my hair it hurts so much.  So until I talk to a doctor who has fibromyalgia all I know is it gets worse.",

It's a steady ache with small, sharp intermittent stabs of pain. I saw my doctor a few days ago, and he glanced briefly at my ear and said there's no redness or swelling inside, so it's probably just allergies and there's nothing I can do about it. He also said something about both eardrums seeming a bit shrunken, but didn't think that was contributing to the problem. If this was ""just allergies,"" why doesn't taking an allergy medicine work?

I got sick over Christmas with sinus infection, croupy cough, fever, lack of appetite, upset stomach, chills, fatigue, headache and sore throat.  The fever and chills have gone (mainly because of the Tylenol and Advil), but the rest has stuck around. My sore throat actually has progressively gotten more and more painful and the thick mucus that's in between my nasal canal and soft and hard pallets is so thick that it feels like thick glue and I can't get rid of it. It's doing a number on my voice and I'm actually choking on it, it sometimes forming a lump at the back of my throat.  I'm on an antibiotic in hopes that it will help, but what happens if things don't get better after the course of antibiotic? Would I have to consider a tonsillectomy?  I'm also wondering if the sore throat is also partially caused by the extremely thick mucus from all the coughing and throat clearing and what I can possibly do about this mucus that I'm choking on? I can't blow it out and I really can't clear my throat to get it out, either. It just sits on top of my hard and soft pallets.

It is one-sided and I'm on my fourth round of antibiotics and doing somewhat better but it's still not quite gone. I am 49 years old female, otherwise healthy. Not overweight, I take no regular medication. My blood pressure has always been near perfect. Until this infection started. Now I have been spiking very high blood pressure and it comes and goes sporadically. I can feel when it goes up because I get lightheaded and I also have a bad taste in my mouth. I am guessing that it's the drainage/infected mucous getting into my system and that is causing my BP to go crazy. It happens when I'm upright for a while. If I stay in a supine position, I am fine. And it doesn't happen right away when I get up. It's gradual. I have a few good hours in the morning before it starts and then I'm dizzy/lightheaded and just feel bad all around. The doctors want to put me on blood pressure medicine but I really feel that it's secondary and will go away if and when this infection ever clears up.  I have had an MRI and MRA and CT scans that show that I have no problems with my brain (they were worried about the dizziness).

Duration of the this problem almost one year. MRI, blood work are all normal. I have seen 2 ENTs and 2 Neurotologists. I have tried: -Zyrtec -Neomycin ear drops -Amoxicillin -Ginkgo biloba -Sudafed -Vitamin E -Warm compression on the ear -Lipo Flavonoid Plus -Acyclovir -Prednisone twice -Diuretic for over 7 months. I am still getting attacks. The latest Neurotologist is telling me that I don't have Meniere's Dx. It is either: 1- Eustachian Tube Dysfunction which ear tube would solve the problem 75% of the time. Tympanostomy should be done 2- Otic Migraine: is also know as Vestibular migraine. According to the Johns' Hopkins Medicine guide ""Vestibular Migraine,"" conditions which may be confused with otic migraines include a series of small strokes, Meniere's Disease. The triggers for the otic migraine are largely food related. Red wine and dried fruit with sulfates are major migraine triggers. Foods with large amounts of caffeine such as coffee and soda must be avoided, as well as monosodium glutamate (MSG), a common component in Chinese food. Otic migraines can also be caused by too much salt in the diet, low blood sugar or a lack of sleep I am now on a Migraine diet to avoid trigger that cause my attack. 3-TMJ (temporomandibular joint syndrome) I will need to get a face massage done. I got the tympanostomy done and it was hell. The results were disastrous. I immediately had a major reduction in my ability to hear. Bass sounds were gone and low level ambient sounds were also gone. In fact my ears felt more plugged than ever and everything sounded like I was under water. Having conversations was a chore as people had to repeat themselves to me. My own voice sounded like I was hearing myself with a bad cold and not like it was coming in through the air. Sounds like I'm underwater. When I speak, I can only hear my voice in my head, as it does when you put your fingers in both ears to speak. I cannot hear my voice 'from the outside'.

I was so ill in 2006 I left TN to go to the Fibromyalgia & Fatigue center in Bellvue , WA. I took herbal IV treatments for 10 months which I could tell some difference regarding fatigue; but, then was told by my husband at the time that my son was in a coma state at a Knoxville hospital. I stopped treatments. They were exceptional when it came to tests as I believe they took over 60 tests. I was told if I had not left TN I would have lived maybe a year. My adrenal gland was shutting down. I wish at times I would never have left TN so I would not have had to watch my son die. My ptsd is due to the day he died which I recently found out my husband..Jeffs stepfather told the hospital he was Jeffs dad and gave permission to turn off life support. I was the only one that could make that decision and I knew my son was going to wake up and be ok. He wasn't brain dead. I have nightmares of him screaming inside for me to help him but no one could hear him. So much makes sense now why the dr wouldn't answer me..no one in the room would tell me what was going on; the death certificate was already in the room. Sorry for getting off subject. Do you have fibro or any of the symptoms related to ME/CFS? I couldn't believe all these years so many of the symptoms I thought was due to the fibro or the ptsd is ME/CFS. The new antidepressant they put me on I feel is helping a lot when it comes to concentration and focus. No side affects which is great. Its Trintellix 10mg once a day. You should have your adrenal checked also. Do you know if there is any test such as mri of the brain that shows anything that would diagnose ME/CFS opposed to CFS? Thank you again.

When it lasted about 3 weeks, I went to a doctor and was given an inhaler (I run so it was to help reduce inflammation while exercising) but was told it was viral, so they could only try and help to relieve the symptoms. The cough stopped affecting my 'everyday' life after about 4 weeks, but training was still largely affected, to the point where I decided to take a break from running to get rid of this. After 7 weeks, it was still bothering me, so my doctor put me on antibiotics just to see if they would help, I finished them, and exercise is still really difficult, so I'm going to say they didn't help. It's now been 9 weeks since I first got sick, and I'm now feeling absolutely exhausted and weak, I keep getting hot flashes, and exercise is still making me cough up phlegm.

First to start out with, a little backstory of how this all started. 3 Months ago I was admitted into the ER and diagnosed with Sepsis. I was shaking, had a cold prickley sensation all over my body, Increased heart rate, and a fever of 102F. During my time in the ER they ran every test that they could think of, including testing my urine, bloodwork, giving me an ultrasound of the heart, and a CT scan of my upper body. However, none of the tests revealed any sign of infection and i was sent home a day and a half later. 2 Weeks had passed since my first ER visist with no noticable issues, until one day when I was just sitting down watching youtube my heart started racing for no discernable reason. Again I was taken to the ER, and when I got there my heart rate was at around 140bpm. They put an Iv in my arm and pumped me with Saline, and about a half an hour later my heart rate was back to normal again and I was sent home that same night. After my second ER visit I went in to see my family doctor, and he reffered me to see a Cardiologist. The Cardiologist put me on a holter monitor for 24 hours and had me do a stress test, wich both revealed nothing out of the ordinary.  A couple of weeks went by, during wich I felt relatively normal until one day when I woke up my eyes felt like they were burning, and my vision had become fuzzy. I went to go sit down at my computer, and found it difficult to look at the screen because the light would hurt my eyes.  I went in to see an Optomologist and they had me do a bunch of tests. They found nothing out of the ordinary besides my Astigmatism (wich I already knew I had) and perscribed me a new pair of glasses.  The new glasses arrived about a week later and improved my overall vision, but I was still experiencing the sensitivity to light and some fuzziness in my sight. To further complicate matters, around this time I started to feel a sensation of Dizziness...like I was moving although I was physically sitting still. It also became increasingly difficult for me to concentrate and think clearly. I went into the family doctor again, and they reccomended that I have an MRI and CT scan done of my brain just to rule out anything serious. About week later, my insurance approved the scan and the results came back normal for both scans. My brain was apparently ""unremarkable"" and normal for someone of my age (26). The sensitivity to light dissipated in time, but the vertigo did not. I was also still having difficulty concentrating, and a high-pitched ringing began to develop in both of my ears, so this time the family doctor reccomended that I see an ENT (Ear Nose and Throat Doctor). The ENT determined that I have an Acute Sinus Infection, and perscribed me antibiotics to take for 10 days. I am 9 days in, and the dizziness has almost gone away entirely, however I do still notice it when I sit down and when I concentrate on objects. I start to feel wobbley and uneven. The ringing is still there as well, but has gone from being high pitched and intolerable to a sort of low ""hum"". I am sorry for the extremely long post, but I felt it important to give my full background from when I first started noticing a problem upto where I am now. These past few months have been really bad for me, and I just want to find out what could be happening. i have been to multiple doctors, multiple experts, and had many different tests done...but really am no closer to understanding what is going on. I would love to think that this was all just some bacterial infection that has been working it's way through my system and that the antibiotics are now flushing out but I just dont know, and that is what is most scary.","Ear Problems , Nasal Problems"

I would not accept covering up the pain with drugs. I wanted to know the cause! Finally found a doctor who sent me to an allergist. I was given 60 shots/scratches in each arm on two separate occasions.   It showed one of my major allergies was the Night Shade family.  This includes Potatoes, tomatoes, red, green, yellow,hot peppers and paprika. I stopped eating them and have been pain free for about 20 years now.   Through personal Research I discovered the poison in the Night Shade plants attacks the long central nerves in the body. This causes inflammation of the nerves which in turn causes horrible pain.   Before I knew this I made potato soup and ate it Friday night, and three times on Sat.. Sunday morning my legs were in so much pain that my brain refused to allow them to move. I dragged myself down to the spa tub and there regained movement after an hour of swirling hot water.  Potato gives me horrible pain in my legs.   I have scars on my arm when my skin came in contact with tomato juice resulting in serious blisters. I had even washed my skin five times with soap immediately following the contact with tomato juice.  The peppers make my body, especially my extremities swell to the point of not being able to close my hands.  Even the smell of tomatoes and peppers cooking will cause me problems.  I was also at the point of constant pain. I shuffled when I walked and had to pull myself up one stair at a time when going up steps.  I was going to a physical therapist who found that my elongated nerves were twisted like a rubber band. The day she straightned out the one in my neck running from below the jaw down toward the shoulder it ""snapped"" so loud she and my husband could both hear it. Electricity ran up her arm and also through my body.  I NO LONGER EAT ANY VEGETABLE from the Night Shade Family. I DO NOT HAVE ANY PAIN!!!! I AM NOT ON ANY PAIN KILLERS, OVER THE COUNTER OR PRESCRIPTION! I full range of all my muscles which are now strong again. I have all kinds of energy again.  what do I eat? Everything else. I have also learned to make some delicious substitutions.  I have a recipe for making a sauce that tastes and cooks like a tomato sauce, but there are no tomatoes in it.  I substitute rutabaga, cauliflower, and white sweet potatoes for potato in recipes. My guests enjoy this substitution also. A favorite for breakfast is raw fried red sweet potatoes and onions salted to taste.   I use horseradish, mustard, white and black pepper to add ""hot"" to recipes. (White and black pepper is not part of the Night Shade Family.)  Beware when buying prepared foods and restaurant foods. These often contain potato starch and or paprika. Just a taste can cause systems that can last several days. I would be happy to answer any questions. bunniepower",

I am taking a multitude of meds...long acting ms contin, short acting oxycodone, cymbalta, zolpidem, long acting xanax, Tylenol, baby aspirin, aspirin, lidoderm patches...supplements taking vitamin D, fish oil , vitamin C, and just started cherry tart.  Am trying to wean down or off opiates and benzo. Have been on many years so under care of physician. Do yoga stretches daily... Have had 5 rounds of physical therapy..tried acupuncture had a horrible experience.. She used burning needles? Have had facet blocks to back and neck with no change.  I looking to wean off or down meds look for a more holistic approach. I am in healthcare myself but am seeking to focus on healing or getting better control over this disease for myself. Looking for advice, anything helpful with regards to treatment modalities supplements, exercise...whatever is working for someone who suffers from this disease. I am sure as I have read posts so many of us are all going through a lot of the things I have descried. Never been on a blog before looking for resources also.

Fibromyalgia,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/fibromyalgia/345/psychiatrist-took-away-tramadol-and-provigil,Psychiatrist Took Away Tramadol and Provigil,"Greetings all, Recently I became so depressed that I was not taking care of myself, my home and finally, my job. It was when I couldn't work that I decided it was time for some serious treatment for my depression. So, I found a residential treatment program, supposedly best in the world for trauma, and signed up. I've never been in any kind of residential treatment, so it was kind of traumatic having all my control over my life taken away, having my bags searched, and having to submit to a strip search (down to my undies).  But then they took away my Tramadol and Provigil! I wouldn't be able to work without the Provigil - it keeps me from falling asleep at my desk, in meetings, etc. I ended up leaving after 10 days rather than the minimum 28 days and now I seem to be in a relatively mild flare. Lots more pain than usual but not unbearable pain. Also, I had what I found out is called a Thunder Clap headache. That's when you suddenly get a crippling pain in your head for up to a minute followed by a bad headache lasting from an hour to several days. I Googled it and it said it could be life threatening and get the the emergency room immediately. So, I did and a CAT scan of my brain showed no damage. So that's great. But I am curious what people think about having my fibro meds (Tramadol and Provigil) taken away and being offered only Ibuprofen and Tylenol in place of my regular meds. I try to avoid Ibuprofen because it can cause bleeding in your stomach, I have taken a lot of it over the years and even before I ever started taking Ibuprofen, for the past 40 years I have had stomach issues - it feels like my stomach is on fire if I don't take Prilosec every day. And I never felt like Tylenol did anything for my pain. They said once I get the depression under control, I'll have more energy and less pain and won't need my fibro meds. So, do you think the Thunderclap headache was a result? What do you think of them taking away my fibro meds? Thank you!!",Medications

Fall is coming soon and this is my favorite season. Spring is OK as we are so ready after a long winter but this is the time of year I feel better*. My stiffness is better, I sleep better and I have more energy in the cool air than I do during summer. Maybe it's from resting during the hot days or all the pool work that is able to get done to move my limbs and muscles. Maybe it's a higher or highest Vit D level as I take my vitamin and sit in the sun. All I know is I am better in Fall. I love the leaves changing and seeing the true color of that leaf before it falls off. Understanding this is the season of their lives. All things have a time to be born, time to live and a time to die. We have to stay in our living phase....moving and joining in to things happening around us. I know it is hard, but caring for yourself is imperative. Be a champion, be amazing....no one is going to care for you like you can. Don't put crap in your mouth, eat well. No soda, your body asks for water. H2O a simple chemical to help it clear its wastes. I so believe we are what we eat. I got here to the board because I asked so much of my body and gave it little. Well it stopped me in my tracks and I could hardly walk. The pain was a 12+ and movement so challenged. The board here 13 years ago saved my life. It is so valuable a home to come back to because of that. I am hoping the fmily will follow and return. Sleep was a big thing that this condition took from me. What helped? A memory foam topper, the thickest I could afford, I started with 3"" and now have 6"" from Overstock.com. It helped the trigger point knots from hurting and making me toss and turn all night.  The warm shower before bed and when I awoke to stretch and move a bit. I learned to change to a new shoe, using different leg muscles as I walked and it changes the whole body frame. Wear good shoes that support you. Paying attention to posture helped my muscles perform and know what was what. It took years of day by day and two steps forward and one step back....to get where I am today.  We are the strongest people I know. The trials this gave me were momentous and no one would understand, only the fmily here who was walking close to the path I had. Please stay and post your issues and needs. I am only here on the weekends now as I am back to work and am full time 5 (ugh) days a week. I do live to work as it takes all I have to do that. But that is OK, I am productive and I make a difference in the world. I hope one change at a time and a bucket of patience for you will make a difference for you too. The strongest med I take is distraction. Laughter and humor is second before the meds I swallow from the MD. After meds I get out and in distraction and the pain and dysfunction lightens up and is put to the back of my head so I can have a day.... my day. Memories made and then kept. We become the sum of our memories. OK, good luck to those who find this site. There are a few that are here. We don't always post but we read and maybe have nothing to add so they don't respond, don't take it that you are ignored...they just have no words to add.  Hugs from me, Nancy B",

It itches so bad and is painful from time to time. I have a constant white discharge. I have been to my PCP and urgent care and had my ear flushed and antibiotics prescribed (both drops and oral), when that did not work, they referred me to an ENT. I have had my ear suctioned out twice and anti fungal powders along with steroid powders put in my ear. both times. I had specific instructions not to get the ear wet and not to put anything in my ear (q-tips, my finger, etc)  My ear is still constantly itching and is producing even more white discharge now. My ENT let me know if the infection is not cleared by my next appointment we are going to have to ""Explore different avenues for treatment"" I am not sure what that means. I have tried to research, but can't find anything on the topic.  Are there any suggestions or questions I should ask my ENT?  Thank you for your help, Savannah",Ear Problems

Can other links be added to a side area? We lost so much.... I like that there are not 100 advertisements (some so bogus for FM) floating and popping up.

Then, I gardened a little less and kneel-ed down, instead of squatting. Although my knees did not hurt for 4-5 years. They started getting very tired when I started riding bicycle as a routine. I have biked almost 4 days straight for an hour each, walked 40 minutes with regular pace and steps for one day, ridden about 4-5 hours one day, and then walked again for 20 minutes for one day. I know that I am supposed to rest for one or two days, yet I thought that walking with regular pace was just like taking a break. It's been about 2 years now ever since I started the biking routine. Not only are my knees tired but also my entire legs. Squatting down created a discomfort sensation. I feel the discomfort even when I go upstairs on the staircase.

Fibromyalgia,https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/fibromyalgia/262/some-tips-for-using-message-boards,Some Tips for Using Message Boards,"Hi All! We've had some questions come up on how to best use these new boards. Thought I'd take some time to try and answer some of them in a new post. If you have more questions or suggestions on how we can improve your experience, please add on to this post. We welcome any and all of your feedback and suggestions! 1. What are tags and how do I use them?  Tags are located in the drop-down menu ""All Topics"" at the top of your board's main page. Selecting a tag from the drop-down will sort your message board so that you only see posts where other members have selected to use that tag when posting. Adding these tags to your posts is encouraged so that others can easily find them, but it is not required. If you have suggestions for other tags you would like to see, please send them our way.  2. How do I get back to the main Fibro community?  The ""breadcrumb"" links that you see at the top of the page can help you navigate from the main board page into a post and back again. You will see Message Boards > Health Conditions > Fibromyalgia > Name of the post you are in.  Clicking on message boards will bring you to the list of all message boards that we have.  Health Conditions will bring you to all health condition message boards (we also have Living Healthy and Pregnancy & Family boards).  And clicking Fibromyalgia will bring you to the main Fibro board. As has been mentioned in a previous post here, if you have selected a tag from the drop-down and then view a post, hitting Fibromyalgia to go back will erase the tag that you have selected. If this happen re-selecting the tag will bring you back to the view you were on. An easier solution that was suggested is that when you are in a post, hit the back button on your browser to return to the exact page you are on (we are working on making this more simple).  3. How can I get in touch with another member? You can now @ reply another member when writing a post, which will alert them that someone is trying to get in touch with them. Simply type an @ symbol before typing another member's name. A list of names will drop down. Select the username you are looking for -- make sure that you leave the string of numbers and letters within the ( ) there and continue your message after that.  For example, if you are trying to alert me type @WebMDAddie and the computer will give you the option to select my username.  4. How do I know if someone responded to a post I created or participated in? Make sure that you keep an eye on the little bell symbol at the top of the page. That will let you know if someone has @ replied you in a message or if there has been any activity on a post that you have created or participated in (there will be a little number up there).  Click on the alert and it will provide a list of the posts. The ones in blue are the ones that you have not yet seen. Click on the posts to view the message. After you have clicked on all alert posts, the number alert will disappear. 5. How to I see older posts on this board? To see older posts, or to just page through all posts on the board, use the little blue arrows on the bottom of the page.  Here's a link of answers to some Frequently Asked Questions that we put together and that you may find helpful:    (it is also located under the Helpful Links heading on the bottom right of every page). I hope that this helps, and please continue to ask more questions (or for more explanation if needed). We know that this transition time can be tough as we are all trying to get used to how these new boards work.  We want to help make this transition as easy as possible!

I'm Not Quite Sure.,"I'll try to make this as short as possible. So I've been feeling a bit gross recently, I quit my job to go to school Full-Time and I have been feeling a bit ill. The feeling I have is in my throat, it seems. This constant dryness in my throat, feels like a hairball is lodged in there. This has been going on for about 2 and a half months, and it actually is stopping me from doing normal every day activities. This feeling makes it hard for me to eat normally as well. If I go out to eat with my family, I take about 2 or 3 bites of my food and suddenly I feel sick, as if I am going to gag. If I go out on an empty stomach, lets say to the grocery store, I still feel a sick from breathing heavier due to walking, causing me to gag. At first it was not so bad, I figured it was   I have had a bad history of sinus infections, I have had 3 sinus infections in about 2 years. I have been to the doctors 4 times within the past month to hopefully clear whatever this ""thing"" is, because I am going out of town in a few weeks. My doctor has given me different types of medicines, one being a Proton Pump Inhibitor, which does not seem to be working at all. She has also told me to take flonase twice a day to try and beat the mucous up (if it is mucous) before my ENT appointment, which hasn't seemed to be working. If I can't even walk or talk without gagging, how will I even be able to play shows with my band?    Today is 11/15/2017, I am going to see an ENT doctor tomorrow morning, hopefully it goes away. I hope that this thread will be able to help others who feel the same way I do. ~~~Tests I've performed~~~ -Sticking my tongue out is instant gag reflex -Anything as physical as walking causes gag after eating immediately -Brushing my tongue causes instant gag and stays until about 5 minutes after -Talking loudly (I have a booming voice) causes the gag reflex -Laughter, unfortunately, causes the gag reflex Thanks for taking your time and looking at this post, I hope to figure out the cause of this issue as soon as possible and talk about it afterwards.",Throat Problems

The following post is something that FMily member MeMe put together awhile back, and that I think has really helped a lot of members of this community. We wanted to make sure that this post made its way to our new home here. So, without further ado, here is her original post:  “My name is MeMe, I'm an FM suffer of 19 years, along with autoimmune diseases & other conditions. We are delighted to have you join us!  You have certainly come to the right place for support & understanding! You'll meet many warm & friendly people here who are willing to share great tips & whom are here to listen & to support you on your new journey living w/ FM. We all have so much in common & you'll fit right in, my friend! You join in and share at any time you like.  *The most important & most difficult is ACCEPTANCE! Then learning to live within your new found limitations. Setting realistic goals & making changes. Learning to say NO.  *Acceptance of the ""New You"" is so important in keeping your self confidence, security, & inner strength! You are still YOU, just differently abled. I firmly believe in remembering/accepting all that you DO have to offer, dispite your current limitations!  *Pacing yoursef is a MUST, even on good days. LISTEN to your body! Getting restorative/restful nights sleep is important. Rest & take breaks when your tired.  *Recommend U trying STOPAIN in spray form, it's very cooling/tingliny, it helps to relieve pain. Found @ WalMart, in the pharmacy section, under $8.00  *Taking hot baths & soaking in epsom salt helps to alleviate the pain & stiffness! Heating pads, electric blankets, DeepHeating WellPatch are also helpful.  *Village Naturals Therapy Mineral Bath Soak for Aches & Pains w/ Eucalytus, Rosehips & Chamomile (contains epsom & sea salts) - great for soaking. It's very cooling & relaxing. Found at WalMart.  *Dr. Bronner's Magic Soap 18-in-1 Hemp Peppermint Pure Castile Soap made w/ Organic Oils, is extremely wonderful for bathing & soaking! It's intensely cooling & tingly, helping to relieve pain temporarily. -A personal favorite of mine- Using a loofah and body brush is great for appliying, to open up pores for optimal results. Found at Vitamin World in a 32 oz. bottle or at drbronner.com  *Doing gentle stretches before & after getting out of bed & after a hot bath helps to loosen tight muscles, taking deep breaths as you do them.  *Massage & hot stone therapy is a great alternative for temp. pain relief.  *Walking & warm water therapy is a gentle way of getting in excercise into your weekly routine. This helps to keep you mobile. You cannot feel your weight in pounds in the water, as you don't feel your pain. Dr's highly recommend this form of exercise!  *Doing gentle exercises & stretches are great for maintaing/gaining muscle strength & increases mobility & flexibility, easing muscle & joint pain & stiffness. Pilates workouts, exercise balls & resistance bands are great tools for stretching!  *Treatment alternatives: accupuncture, biofeed back, psychotherapy/counseling, PT, aqua therapy, & massage.  *Simplify your life. Avoiding/preventing as much stress in all areas of your life as much as possible is key, as this fuels added pain.  *Following the recommendations of your dr & taking prescriptions as prescribed, responsibly.  *Educate yourself & family, keeping up with new research. Print out info for friends/family.  *Learning to ask for help can be very beneficial, as this will relieve you of some tasks others can do.  *Have a good support system. Staying connected with other people to avoid isolation & depression is theraputic.  *Excercise your brain daily to help keep your mental faculties stronger & to help brain fog by doing cross words games. Challenge your mind doing mental exercises to keep your mind sharp.  o	*Know that FM is not life threatening! Accept your symptoms wax & wane, but flares are transient & ultimately improve.  *Accept that life is different for you & know that U can still find joy in your life & you are valuable!  Again, its so nice to meet you, my friend. You've found such a wonderful group! I hope to get to know you better. So sorry your suffering with FM just like all of us. But we are always here to pick each other up! You'll get much encouragement from many. Hope you stay with us! Keep well.

Then, all of a sudden, the cold hit a rough spot. She had a mid-grade fever and symptoms were getting worse. After about 3 days, the fever went away and she returned to school. She felt like a normal cold for about a month (mild symptoms). During which, she was hit with pink eye that was taken care of by a prescription. Then, a severe cough came on about the end of October, sounding like barking. The cough was going on for weeks so I took her to the doctor. The doctor prescribed her 850 of Amoxicillin. The cough did not go away throughout the treatment, but did improve. Now, she has finished her prescription and the cough was better (not gone) but is now coming back after 3 days.

Going into a cold climate (cold room) after a hot shower. I've been told that having a hot shower then going into a cold area, such as; a cold room or outside (10°C) will twist my tongue or shift it to a side. Going from hot air into cold air is bad overall. Is this true? Is it harmful in anyway? 2. Not wearing a jacket will have some negative long term effects on my body. I am in a habit of not really getting myself warm enough in a chilly weather. I would sleep with a thin blanket and thin clothes, I would get outside where it's 10-8°C with thin clothes, I don't really use much of heating devices even though my family can't live without them, & I am kind of making my body adapt to low temperatures. My questions are; Am I harming my body? Are there any long term effects? Should I continue what I'm doing? 3. I don't feel low temperatures as much as other people. I would start wearing jackets a month after everyone around me does, I don't use heaters as I previously stated, and I would not get cold as much as others do. Is this normal?  4. Getting into cold areas will result in the flu/common cold. Is this true? I did my research and from what I understood is that low temperatures would result in a decrease in efficiency of the immune system, which would allow the flu virus to infect the body. Am i right? Can I get sick from being in a cold environment (without a virus)? 5. What happens to the lungs when they shift air temperatures quickly? For example; moving from heated car to a 0-3°C weather, or vise versa Will any thing happen to my lungs? 6. What happens to my skin when I shift temperatures instantly? for example; Ending a hot shower with cold water (to reduce acne). If it is no trouble, I would like someone (professional/doctor) to answer these questions. Thank you for your time :)",

It started off with what seemed to be bronchitis but was never diagnosed. After one round of antibiotics I got a bit better but my cough was still terrible. After two or three weeks of intense fatigue and a cough that was still so bad it kept me up at night and sometimes caused me to throw up, I was put on steroids and given an inhaler... then when that didn't work I had a chest x-ray done which didn't show anything, so I was put on another round of antibiotics which seemed to finally start working. My cough was slowly starting to go away after two months. THEN a couple of weeks ago, before the cough fully went away, I got sick again with what appears to be the same thing. So the cough was back in full swing, along with completely losing my voice and other symptoms. I was put on antibiotics again, the third time in three months, and now I'm finally getting better again, although the cough is still sticking around a bit. I understand it's a tough time of the year for sickness, but I haven't been healthy since mid-November. I still haven't received a diagnosis for whatever I've had for this long, the few tests I've had done haven't shown anything. But it occurred to me that while I usually don't get sick for this long, whenever I get a cold it turns into a sinus infection, and that happens several times a year. I feel like I'm sick all the time. Is it possible my immune system is just low? If it is, why would that be? Should I go to a doctor about why I keep getting sick or should I not be worried?

Part of this misdiagnosis (what I believe it to be anyway), could be partly due to me not relaying as much information as I could, as I felt the doctor seemed rather rushed. Slight hearing loss was noticed on the morning of 2/13; the day after I started wearing my new pair of headphones and sound equipment. I did not think they were causing much damage as it wasn’t really much louder than my old setup but I did feel pressure and itchiness (both outside and inside the ear), I think this is because the low frequencies were much more pronounced. For the following week, buzzing in my ears started to get worse and I eventually began to feel a little fluid in my ear. I was then prescribed prednisone on 2/21; slowly hearing came back slightly until 3/2, where I felt 70% of my hearing had returned.  However one very significant problem remained, and one in which I feel I cannot articulate effectively. It doesn’t feel like my eardrums vibrate much at all. I don’t think this is a very accurate description though, the lack of sensation I’m getting is when you go to a concert or listen to bass accentuated music, there is that noticeably pleasant vibration you get. I’ve always considered this sort of the texture or layered part of music.  My audiogram displayed ‘Normal Hearing’, though it feels far from it. I have scoured the internet and I have only read of one somewhat similar case (their cause way unknown). I ran into this case again 3/16 just six hours from my ENT visit. Same audio setup, although at very low volume this time around with significant ringing unlike the first time. Ringing stopped a couple days later (but the hum from the first incident has remained). I just started another prednisone prescription after going to urgent care on 3/20. Any Help would be greatly appreciated! -AJ",Ear Problems

Background  Through my 30s, I had earwax problem that formed solid dry earwax in my left ear and stuck there. I used to carefully remove this solid dry earwax myself using metallic type of earwax remover. Sometimes in the process I scratched my left middle ear and bled but it never been infected back then. I was also told that my right middle is very normal as any healthy middle ear can be but some of the ear specialist said my left middle ear was showing minor difference comparing to my right middle ear. For the first time in my life (as far as I remember) I had both ears infection in my 30s after using a prescribed steroid based ear drop. In desperation of getting my normal right ear to get it back before the ear drop and getting a better result for my left ear, I visited other ear specialists through the last 15+ years.  I thought I was successful when I run into ear specialist who I thought diagnosis the real problem for my ears. He prescribed me steroid based Elocon 1% lotion for two months and it gave me a big relief for the time being when I was on it. I had very burning sensation in my ears when I was using the Elocon 1% lotion, especial my problematic left ears. That was over 15+ years ago. Since then I have visited over 10 ear specialists and none of them find the real problems for the constantly coming back ear infection other than treating me with steroid based ear drop whenever my ears infected.  Current The last five years I have some ear drainage including some blood when I lay down at night and woke up in the morning, especially in the summer. The last ear specialist told me my ear problems are skin disease known as Lichen Planus. He put me for 2 month continues use of Tacrolimus. I started out with my chronically defective left ears for one week. Unfortunately, the problem for my left ear worsened instead of getting better. My hearing ability gradually decreasing.",

There's like a line but I can tell by feeling it it's the bone and it's a little slanted. While wiping my nose a few times and how I wiped it wasn't normal is using a napkin wiping the outer part and having to stick to piece with my finger to wipe it and while doing it caused pain.

The main thing is that her nose is awfully congested and runny (if she leans back, you can see how filled and overflowing it is). She also has a minor wet cough, but that is much more manageable. By now we have figured out quite the ""system"" - since she needs to blow her nose every 2-10 minutes (no joke), she has packs of tissues in her desk and bag at school, there are boxes all over my house, and at dance, she makes sure there is always a box in the studio she's dancing in. But she is very uncomfortable. And now as she's becoming a more competitive dancer, competitions have been very difficult for us (for her solo, she was blowing her nose until she went on stage and I was ready with a tissue backstage for when she came off) and we are still too scared to send her to a convention. And it doesn't help that she can't breathe through her nose, so she gets out of breath so quickly.  We can't really travel with her or even go on day trips because of this. When we went on a ski trip, she skied one day, constantly stopping on the hill for tissues and water (her throat gets so dry because of her heavy mouth breathing) and she came home with the messiest face mask and jacket I've ever seen. She didn't ski another day. And when we went to Florida, she was in the room for most of the day because she couldn't really swim. And car/plane rides are miserable.   The coping mechanisms we've developed so far, besides keeping tissues handy at all times, have been a) we do a sinus rinse every few days (haven't found this to be helpful) b) she does nasal spray five times a day (7, 11, 2:30, 6 or 7, before bed) which we have found to be helpful, but you're supposed to clear your nose before which she can't really do.. c) she will occasionally take a decongestant. Her nose is also so red and raw from blowing it like 2 or 3 hundred times a day so we put stuff on it for her whenever she needs it. And she has an inhaler for when her cough is bad.  We've gone to our doctor and some specialists and the only answer they've had has been that it is very severe nonallergic rhinitis and that something is causing her mucus to rapidly overproduce (I know, gross!). They say surgery couldn't help because it's not about her adenoids or anything like that. So, do you guys have any ideas of what could be causing this or any ideas for some more coping mechanisms to help? Thank you so much :)","Cold , Throat Problems , Nasal Problems"

Two weeks ago I went to an ENT who found a tonsil cyst and prescribed 15 days of Augmentin (875-125 MG tablets 2x per day). I was given a throat culture at the time and the results came back negative for bacterial infection one week later. I went back to the ENT today (2 weeks after original appointment) and I was given a new prescription for Cleocin (300 MG 3x per day). I was also given a sinus CT scan which did not find any visible sign of a sinus-related cause. I'm worried about taking 30 straight days of antibiotics, especially since no bacterial infection could be found in the culture. In the past 2 weeks, my condition has been improving somewhat (ear and throat pain have subsided), but I am still having some on-and-off throat and tonsil symptoms. I still have 2 doses left of the original antibiotics, and my gut is telling me I should wait at least few days before starting the next round of antibiotics to see if my condition improves (if I take it at all), but is there a reason to take the 2nd antibiotic immediately after my first is finished?

I had the worst headaches I've ever experienced along with terrible back and neck pain. I eventually developed severe anxiety and panic attacks. All of this I believe was due to lack of sleep, the lack of sleep was caused by my tonsils covering about 90% of my throat. I had done four or five rounds of antibiotics, several blood tests for deficiencies and mono etc. One morning I woke up with ear pain and the right side of my face was swollen and saggy, I was put on another round of antibiotics and had a nasal spray and a pain killer for a sinus infection. I was put on a waiting list to see an ENT specialist but he said ""my tonsils are large but there is no reason for him to remove them because a tonsillectomy is one of the worst surgeries.."".

I took antibiotics around month 3, however had no improvement. Today and yesterday, I have been having dark black snot that is 'thick and greasy'. From what I have read online this type of black snot is usually a sign of a dangerous fungal infection? (Note I do not smoke at all or anything like that) However I have no fever or sinus pain. So here is my main question: Is black snot the first symptom of active fungual sinusitis? If so, how long afterwards would fever come?(and subsequent death?) Normally I would visit a doctor however I have been traveling in Eastern Europe all summer and now Croatia. Last week i got severe cramps and vomiting that wouldn't go away. I was taken by the hotel owner to a Croatian hospital and they gave me emergency appendectomy. The surgeon briefly told me that my appendix was black and leaking fluid and they had to clean the abdomen. I didn't get much more info than that. Not sure if this weakened my immune system alot, I didn't eat for about 3 days and was very weak.  One theory I have is that I had been having inactive fungal sinusitis all summer which has now activated during my appendix episode. I want to fly home to USA for sure, however I can't tell how urgent this black snot thing might be. Would you recommend catching a flight home immediately?(and trying to get wheel chair help at airport) or can i afford to wait about 2 weeks for my abdomen to heal up more.

I immediately told my mother about it and she took me to the doctors, they brushed it off and said it was a normal migraine and that it would go away eventually. The pain never went away. I started getting very bad jaw aches, to the point where I’d start crying. I went to my dentist, they said it was normal and for two years straight they recommended me to do jaw excercizes and such. I thought it was foolish because it had to be more than that. I eventually complained about it again and my mom took me to another dentist, they took my wisdom teeth out saying that was the root of the pain, the pain actually subsided for two-three months but it eventually came back. I told them once again and they told me to take pain killers. During all of this, my jaw pops and clicks and when I eat something rough, my hearing becomes foggy and things become inaudible. On top of all of this I was also hearing a ringing in my ears and it’s been 2 YEARS of this unbearable ringing, everywhere I go I hear it. One day I started experiencing vertigo symptoms, I was sobbing for 9 days straight, it lasted 9 days but went away. I went to the doctors the day my vertigo started, they told me to drink water because I was dehydrated, I did drink water during the time being but it didn’t go away until 9 days after. I am very scared that it comes back again and my doctors always seem to brush these things off and blame it on anxiety.

Can you please suggest which doctor I should see or tests to take to shed light on my condition?,"Hi, thanks for viewing my post. Two years ago, I considered myself fairly healthy. I rarely get the flu, cold or any other common diseases; I was generally more happy and contented with my health and body. Now I can't say the same.  I'm 23 years old male from the Philippines and I'm just very disappointed that I'm feeling sickly and weak when I should be at the prime of my life. I have been calling off for work, skipping occasions and no longer seeing acquaintances. Probably every two or three months, I would just get fever accompanied by cold and fatigued. My throat would also get infected probably from post-nasal drips, my mouth will have painful mouth ulcer, usually just one and on some occasions, my lymph node will swell. This would just derail me from being hopeful and positive. I am very young and ambitious but being sickly is my number one hindrance. I really value my health. I don't have vices, I sleep properly regularly, I exercise and avoid as much as possible eating unhealthy food. I also keep my stress level low. Still despite all my effort to preserve my body, it still fails me. I am very willing to see a doctor and take tests. But can you please suggest what doctor should I see and tests to take? What questions will also be helpful in knowing what causes my immune system being weak? Tests I have taken in the past: HIV non-reactive I also had my chest lumps tested through estrogen blood test and ultrasound but they turned out to be excess fat and normal.

I've been on antibiotics twice and that always clears my facial pain but I will still get intermittent sinus headaches and the pressure on my ear. I've been to the dr after the antibiotics were done and everything looks better in that aspect, my nose is no longer red, the fluid on my ear is gone. I am on flonase and I constantly have post nasal dripage. I've been ok with all of this until a few days ago when I noticed my right pupil was bigger than the left. I saw my eye dr who checked everything out and said the eyes look healthy but they are indeed about 1mm different. She is sending me to a neuro-opthamologist for some neuro testing just to be safe. I am also set up for a CT scan in the next few days of my sinuses. I am terrified this is something horrible like a tumor. What are the chances that the sinus pressure is causing my right pupil to dilate more than the left?

Sorry, I'm very new to this forum, so I'm not aware of any kind of unwritten rules. For awhile now I've been having a whitish discharge from my right eye, roughly constantly. About a week now, stopped for awhile, and then came back again. Left eye did it for about a day and then stopped and hasn't come back, but the right eye is still going to town. When it's worse I can't really see out that eye, everything's cloudy. It also crusts close when I sleep which it doesn't normally do, and the left one is fine. I would have a picture but it's decided to dry up right now so I'll have to grab it later, when it's running again. I can say it likes to get in both corners of my eye in coagulated blobs, along my eyelashes more likely on the inner (towards nose area), and if it gets out it will harden into a crust that I have to fight to wipe away. I'm worried this could be an infection, I really don't have money for a doctor or I wouldn't be here right now :P Don't really know what I'm doing here but I figure it's better then nothing.

I have an extremely pressure-like feeling in my head, as well as the kind of dizziness that feels like I'm drunk or in a boat, all of the time. Mostly, the dizziness is a feeling, but sometimes - especially recently - it is accompanied by a visual shaking, which I have noticed is usually in time with my heart beat. Around when this started, I have also suffered hearing loss and tinnitus. I have been diagnosed with several ear infections since about a year ago, the first one around this time last year, and the most recent about two months ago. I have, however, been to an ear doctor, and he said he could see nothing wrong with my ears. He did a hearing test on me, and I apparently didn't do well - I have hearing loss in my right ear in low frequencies. My ears hurt most of the time, and there is often clear fluid coming out of them, even when I have no ear infection. Mostly the pain is as if a sharp icicle has been jabbed into my ear, and mostly only my right ear, but I also feel bad pressure in both. I often close my hands tightly over them in an attempt to make the pressure stop. It rarely works at all but it's the only thing I can do. Sound often comes through ""fuzzy"", and my ears do an odd, vibrating/clenching thing in response to sound. My eyesight has been getting worse. I got glasses about a year ago, and by March this year they were no longer good enough - better than with no glasses, but still not good. It has only gotten even worse since March, I used to only have poor long distance vision only last year - now I have to squint or even put my glasses on just to use my phone. My blood pressure often goes too high or too low, usually by about 10, so around 150 or 90, give or take. I also have a high heartrate - over 90 resting, up from over 80 resting last year - and it often goes up to and beyond 150 and beats so hard that I can hear it. Sometimes it hurts really bad and feels like it stops for a few seconds. However, I have had both a heart ultrasound and a 24 hour heart monitor and they said there is nothing wrong with my heart. I also have occasional hot flushes and have been in bed red-faced and dripping with sweat even on the coldest winters night. My symptoms worsen when I am anything but lying down - within less than a minute of even just sitting up a little bit, my heart races and I feel so, so dizzy, with insane head pressure and an almost immediate headache. I often refuse to go to hospital as I know they will make me wait, sitting up in a wheelchair for hours and I cannot handle that. It's so bad that I'd honestly rather die than sit in a wheelchair for hours. Most days I can't even make it to the bathroom without help. I have had ""drop attacks"" - like passing out but without losing consciousness - several times this year, and whenever I stand up I feel like I am going to faint. Because of this, I am stuck in bed basically 24/7.  I have terrible neck and back pain, to the point that I have hired someone to come to my house to massage me. I also have lung problems that have not yet been diagnosed, my breathing is wheezy most of the time and my lungs hurt. I also have a bad cough, since early 2016. I have been tested for whooping cough and meningococcal and I don't have them. I also had a chest X-ray that came up with nothing abnormal. My nose also hurts quite often, with the same cold pain I get in my ears. I have been to a neurologist as well as the cardiologist and ear doctor. I have stayed in hospital for over a week getting tests - the heart ultrasound, 24 hour heart moniter, and two MRIs - one for the brain and one for the ears. I also had another MRI last year - nothing showed up. I have been to so many doctors, but nobody has any clue what this could be - if they even try to find out at all. I unfortunately was diagnosed with anxiety over a decade ago, and because of this, and that nothing else has been found, most doctors are convinced this is only anxiety. It is not. I know my own body - I've only lived in it for more than half a century - and I know something isn't right. I can tell the difference between an anxiety attack and whatever this is, and besides, I have taken a Valium when I have felt bad and it has done nothing but make me not care what's happening. I can still feel the symptoms. My most recent hospital trip was very unfortunate, the doctor immediately stopped taking notes as soon as I mentioned I was on anxiety medication, and when I refused to agree that this is only anxiety, he actually looked like he was going to physically lash out at me. His last words to me before I was wheeled out of the room to go home (where I violently threw up from a migraine) were that I had to accept this was anxiety. He had me speak to a psych doctor while I was there, and as we spoke she seemed to believe there was something physical, telling me I need to get a regular psych team organised because only then would doctors like him would have to listen to the physical symptoms. But when the doctor came back he said the psych doctor agreed this was just anxiety - I don't know if he was lying or if he'd convinced her it was just anxiety or if she was lying when she said she agreed with me, but I felt so utterly betrayed. Since then I haven't dared to go back to the hospital, not even when Health Direct (on-the-phone health advice) said they wanted to call an ambulance for me when my heartrate was over 150. I begged them not to as I could not sit up in a wheelchair for hours and get even sicker, only to have to go through that humilation and being condescended to like that doctor did. I have had several suggestions as to what this could be. The two that seem most likely, to me, are Intracranial Hypertension and Spontaneous Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak... however, it has been an uphill battle to try to get tested for these, I first found out about them several months ago and have suggested it to several different doctors and have come no closer to getting tested. I suggested a CSF leak to the horrid doctor at the hospital and he insisted that it cannot happen without a serious trauma, like a car accident. I will be seeing another neurologist on the upcoming Friday, but I have no faith in getting any results. I don't know what kind of a person this neurologist will be - if he will listen to me and get the tests I want, or if he will immediately give up on me the second he finds out I have anxiety. I have absolutely no quality of life at all. I haven't seen any of my friends in years, most days I can't even sit up to watch tv, or even use my phone to watch YouTube as the head pressure, headaches, dizziness and eye pain become unbearable. It has taken me several days to write this post in my memos app as I cannot stand being on my phone for long. My laptop has been used less than ten times in all of 2017 as I feel terrible using it, and I have seen only four movies at home this whole year - I am counting a Titanic documentary as a movie due to it's length. I can't even just listen to music or podcasts because of my headaches, earaches, and the fuzziness and vibrating/clenching. All I can do is lay there in the dark with my eyes closed, clutching my head and wishing I could finally die and escape this. I find myself thinking ""I don't want to be alive any more"" at least once a day. I have so much wasted potential, all I want is to do my part to help the world by offering the skills I have, but now I can barely even text my friends. My best friends have had weddings I have been unable to attend, and had children I have not met yet. I have had no love life since this started, I have never been so lonely for so long. I need my life back! I am not even thirty yet, too young to have my life stopped like this. Please, if you have any suggestions or advice, let me know. I live on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia - if anyone knows of anyone around there that will take my case seriously and will try to help, please please tell me! I am willing to travel to Sydney if needed. Recently I found out about an Undiagnosed Diseases Program in Western Australia, and briefly allowed myself to have a bit of hope that they would take me in and help me, however after many goose-chase phone calls and unanswered emails, I found out this program is only for young children who are in the Western Australian health system. I was willing to travel that far just for the possibility that they can help me. This is obviously a difficult case and it's not going to be solved with a blood test or an MRI, but nobody is willing to look hard enough, or even look past my anxiety! I just don't know what to do. Every day is an unbearable hell and it's only getting worse and worse. Please help...",Ear Problems

She then took a picture of each eye - a fundus photo I think it was called and compared the two pictures from 10 years ago till now. The optic nerve from 10 years ago showed a change in the left eye. She called it something else (I think it might have been a cup but not sure) said it looked a little longer than 10 years ago. In the right eye, she did not see much of a difference and attributed that to different camera etc. So, she wants me to have a visual field test + some sort of scan. She said she is not diagnosing glaucoma but the left eye is suspicious enough to want to check out. As a result of the scan, she says they will either want to keep monitoring or start treatment. I assume if the advice is to keep monitoring it is not glaucoma yet. If it is start treatment, sounds like it means glaucoma has started. Treatment she says would be 1 drop in each eye (or maybe just the left) once before bedtime. So I have several questions: 1. Does it sound like there is glaucoma here?  2. Can it only affect 1 eye? And, do the drops work?  3. thought drops were to relieve pressure, but if pressures are 17-18 why would I need drops? 4. If it is glaucoma I assume it is 'normal tension glaucoma' because the pressures are normal, it would make sense that this is a slower than one with higher pressures.  5. what type of scan?",

Doctor did the full body checkup and everything is normal except I am in a Prediabetes stage and have high BP. She prescribed pills for high bp and asked me to take some probiotics to help with loose stool. My Chest pressure is gone on left side but I still feel some discomfort and one day its feels very negligible the next day it’s little different. My blood pressure is normal my x ray was normal taken 1 month back. My stool consistency was getting better after taking probiotics for 1 month still soft but not completely shapeless but in between its again like diarrhea after I stop taking the same.

I have gone to the emergency room now over 4 times only for them to hand me a prescription of permetrin cream and send me on my way. When i would explain to them i had pulled lice from my eyebrows and could feel them in my eyelashes as well. I also felt them crawling in my nose and from there evidently they crawl down into my throat. At first i thought many times i had a hair in my throat but eventually found about 3 in my mouth. I am so disgusted with the fact that i have been ignored by medical professionals that are suppose to be there to listen to my symptoms and help me in finding a diagnosis that they can treat. Im assuming the fact that since im a middle aged woman with no health insurance and on disability they could care less. And they have done nothing to take my visits with one being where i had burned my eyes so bad with hydrogen peroxide just to rid myself of these evil creatures that now exist on my body along with inside. Please understand lice can and do live inside the nasal cavity along with being in my mouth and now i have body lice along with pubic lice. And i dont have sexual contact in any form and i am very clean in every way. I need help and im about to lose touch with reality if someone doesnt take what im saying seriously. Im very infested that i cant even where makeup thats when these nasty things really go nuts. I am so sensitive to them living on me and in me so long i can feel them on my face and nose and mouth. PLEASE im begging i need someone to tell me how i can rid myself of such a magnitude of infestation. Im ready to put a bullet in my head and kidding aside i mean this. I cant take this much longer. Im infested inside and out and i need someone to help me. Im not crazy but going that way due to being infested for over a year and nobody wanting to listen and help. This came from an apt i moved into that was infested with bed bugs, fleas and lice so bad that within 6 months i furiously moved out and demanded a months rent and deposit back due to the infestation. Now that i have had to throw all my furniture away and all the hell i have been through and still going through i will be seeing them in court. Im going to sue with such intensity they will never do this to another human being. Please give me some medical direction so i can feel human again because i am losing touch with reality and ready to end my life if i have to continue living with bugs crawling inside and outside of my body.

My throat area of the neck ached and tightness across the chest. I waited for a little while ... Is this a heart attack. I decided I needed to go to the E/R and be evaluated for heart attack. It was not A-Fib ... my blood pressure was fine and even.  When I to to the E/R they did an EKG ... normal. They did blood tests ... several ... and there was no enzymes in my blood showing I had had a heart attack. They did a chest x-ray ... normal. In the past I have had Asthma, but has been totally non existent. But they decided to give me a breathing treatment. I felt better ... but I also had been sitting on a gurney and not moving.  I went home at 5 a.m.... and it started all over again, but worse. It was only on the right side of my front neck and going down to my breast area. I could not lay down, that made it much worse. So I sat up all night. Around 9 a.m. I called my PCP office and was able to get in that afternoon. The paid was still there. The PCP examined me and could not find anything wrong ... other than my pain. She said could be a pulled muscle (don't think so), I thought it could be Pleurisy, or it could be Carotid Artery Dissection. So treatment was to go home ... take a muscle relaxer, anti inflammatory meds, and I could take Hydrocodone. Also scheduled me for a sonogram of the Carotid. I sat up on the couch into the night. Fell asleep sitting up. But did wake up in the middle of the night and they pain was gone. I crawled into bed and slept. The sonogram was done today, but I do not have any results yet.

Had a Balloon Sinuplasty December 2014 with fantastic results. I had had sinus and allergy issues for 29+ years and this seemed to almost cure me.  January-February 2017: I take 2 rounds of antibiotics and have been in acupuncture for 3 months. My ENT does every test he can do including CT scan. He finds nothing. Thinks it is my teeth. Go to 2 dentists-no TMJ. My neck is finally starting to feel better.  June -August 2017: Neck pain and ear pain starts again intermittently. Gets worse end of July. Get an MRI and see hand specialist. No C7 issues and CTS is not worse, no treatment needed. Stopped acupuncture in June because of neck pain and it wasn't helping (plus really expensive). For about a week, it feels like something is stuck in the left side of my throat.  September 2017: Neck and ear pain with a full feeling and like something is stuck in my throat. This is all on the left side, always has been. My CTS is worse on the left and I have horrible Sciatica related pain (started about 6 years ago). Also have difficulty swallowing at times.

It has been going on for at least 8 years and it's long overdue to finally do something about it. I constantly have phlegm in the back of my throat and it makes me uncomfortable. It's colorless. Whenever I spit it out or swallow it, it comes back in the matter of seconds. Naturally, it's the worst in the morning, when after a whole night I might spend a good 2 or 3 minutes just clearing my throat. Sometimes it hurts a bit when I speak for a longer period of time (it's not very painful but irritating). I need to use my voice as a public speaker. I always used to speak very clearly but now I’ve noticed that I have to make a conscious effort to pronounce my words correctly, because sometimes the nasal sounds come out somewhat “blurry”. Also it seems that there is too much saliva in my mouth. It’s not particularly noticeable when I’m not speaking, but when I do, I have to swallow more often then I used to.  I have to blow my nose every few hours, especially in the morning. Everyday for the last few years I wake up with a stuffy nose. During the day it’s not a big issue but it’s still there. Even after I blow my nose I feel that I’m not breathing absolutely clearly. I’m not suffocating or anything, but I know that it’s not right. My nostrils feel heavy and tight, and the inhaled air dry and stiff.  I should mention that I do suffer from seasonal allergies that intensify in the Summer, although I didn’t have them at all until 5 years ago (they came a few years after the phlegm). I do not take any prescribed medication for the allergies except some universal anti-allergy pills that you can get from your local drugstore (and they don’t work at all) and an asthma inhaler.  I’m in a good physical shape, I play sports from time to time. I don’t smoke, rarely drink. My diet is probably not the best. I’m not fat but sometimes I forget to eat vegetables and stuff.  Based on all of this, could you tell me what do you think about my condition? I would prefer to try some natural remedy first and see if it works, before I take prescription meds.

"Ear, Nose & Throat",https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/26460/nasal-and-facial-pain,nasal and facial pain,"Hi. I am male, early 40s, generally very healthy. I suffer daily from nasal and facial pain, usually starting in the left side of my nose and progressing to the left side of my face. Right side is never affected. The pain starts every day when I enter the air-conditioned office at work, but can also be triggered by pollutants such as smoke. The pain diminishes when I leave the office, but does not disappear entirely. Some history: Until about 20 years ago I never had any nasal problems. And then I had a cold, followed by sinusitis which caused stinging pain below both eyes - I think maxillary sinus area. After a week or so, the pain on the right side disappeared, but the pain on the left persisted. This did eventually stop, but I then had a period of about 3 years with regular sharp pain in the inside corner of my left eye (lacrimal sac / lower ethmoid sinus area). Antibiotics had no effect, and nasal endoscopy revealed no abnormalities. Eventually the pain went away, but reappeared intermittently for short spells triggered (I think) by dry or smoky air. Not sure if it's relevant, but I also suffer from hayfever in the summer (and have always done so). No other allergies that I'm aware of. And then about 3 years ago, I moved to a new (sealed and air-conditioned) office at work. Within 15 minutes of entering the room for the first time, I began to get the familiar pain in the left side of my nose, and during the day the pain spread across my face. I have since moved to another office, but the problem persists. The pain often diminishes overnight when I am sleeping, but returns the next day. One thing I have noticed is that the skin between the corner of my left eye and my nose (where the pain first originated) seems to protrude very slightly. If I hold my nostrils closed and inhale, the skin gets sucked inwards to become the same as it is around the other eye. Similarly if I breathe out with my nostrils closed, that area swells. The effect is small but perceptible, and is left-side only. I have had another nasal endoscopy, which again revealed nothing abnormal. I have tried antihistamines and beconase nasal spray (beclometasone dipropionate), and also a capsaicin (pepper) spray. Steam inhalation and massage of the area may help very slightly. I have been on low dose amitriptyline for pain management for the last couple of years. The amitriptyline I think helps a bit. I use a pure saline nasal spray every hour or so at work, which definitely helps somewhat in the short-term, particularly with a prolonged spray action and holding my head upside down. The only time I have no pain at all is if I have a heavy cold with runny nose - this miraculously causes all symptoms to disappear, however it does cause a bit of postnasal drip when sleeping, such that I wake up coughing. I'd be grateful for any opinions or advice! I'm also unsure whether top of nose/corner of eye falls under ENT or opthalmology.",Nasal Problems

I had very minor flu symptoms. At this time, I noticed my right lymph node was swollen, but painless. I self-medicated and took a course of Cipro. A week later, I saw my family doctor who was acting as my OB/GYN. He noted that both of my lymph nodes were swollen. My flu was gone. I no longer had pregnancy symptoms. He didn't offer any explanation or treatment. 5 days later I had a traumatic miscarriage. It was extremely painful and bloody. I had my first appointment with the Maternal Fetal doctor a few days later. She could not determine the reason for the miscarriage. She discovered I was anemic from the blood loss during the miscarriage and prescribed me Iron. I didn't see my family doctor until July 24th because his office scheduled me the wrong day in June and couldn't get me in until July 24-- yeah, they still thought I was in the middle of a troubled pregnancy (3 prior miscarriages during the previous 12 months) when they didn't promptly reschedule me. On July 24, my lymph nodes in my neck were even larger. When I turn my neck, they 'pop' with a movement as my neck 'innards' move to make room for them. I told my family doctor. He told me he had no idea and would have to ask a more knowledgeable doctor and get back to me. He said he'd recheck my iron levels and call me. No one called me, so I called the nurse and the receptionist told me it must be fine or someone would have called me. On August 25, I saw my family doctor. My lymph nodes were still huge. He told me he forgot to ask another doctor and would get back to me next month about it. In the meantime, he noted my Iron levels in July were still only at a 9, so he told me to keep taking the Iron supplements and he'd call another doctor to ask about my lymph nodes and he'd call me about my iron levels. That was his only treatment for me. He took blood for my iron level but no other testing was done. The next day, the nurse called me about my iron levels from July. I told her I'd already seen the doctor in the meantime, so she called me a month too late. (smh).  Obviously my doctor and his support staff are incompetent. It took the nurse 5 weeks to send my records to the maternal fetal clinic so they'd see me, even though the doctor said I was at such high risk that I needed to be seen immediately. I miscarried before the nurse even sent my paper work in, despite me calling every day. I live in a very remote location and this is my ONLY option for a doctor. I'm 43.

It lasts for days and sometimes weeks. Once I went to the GP about it, but they didn't know. I don't have ear problems, nor excess wax and normally my ears are okay (they sometimes get blocked for hours and hours after swimming with water caught inside them - I think I've sorted that one by putting in soapy water to break the surface tension of the trapped water). It is just when I reduce the calories and also exercise; it's both ears. I think it might be something to do with pressure in the Eustachian tubes, but don't know why or how. When it happens I'm normally feeling weaker from lack of calories. Swallowing doesn't help. It will come back to normal when I eat again (after a while).

However, about two years ago I started to notice the hearing in my right ear sort of deteriorating. I didn't think much of it at first, but now that I'm in college and constantly around people it's very noticeable. It's extremely hard to follow along with conversations and even sometimes hear things one on one. I've had my hearing checked (a couple of months ago) and they told me that I did have some hearing loss but it wasn't enough for hearing aids. But I honestly feel like my hearing has gotten worse in my ear and I'm starting to notice some dizzy spells occasionally. For example, yesterday I was sitting down and not even moving around and suddenly it felt like I was spinning and it was hard to hold my head up. I chalked it up to just being tired, but now I'm wondering if it might be related. I have also been getting ear aches more frequently in the past couple of months. Am I being paranoid, or do I need to see a doctor about this?",Ear Problems

However, one week ago today, I woke up coughing early in the morning and could not breathe for a good minute or two. The same thing happened this morning, one week later. I have been to the doctor's office twice and the ER, but was not able to get any answers other than it may be a bronchial infection. They even performed a CT Scan on me. They have given me antibiotics, steroids, which I have been taking for more than a week now, and I still have the same symptoms. I have also been given a respiclick inhaler which I can use if I cannot breathe. I also moved from my apartment to my father's home for the past week, and could notably tell a difference in the quality of the air. What is concerning me the most is that I still had a massive fit where I could not breathe, for the second time. Back in June, my roommate and I found some black mold on the outside of our A/C unit and were concerned. We notified our apartment community office and they came and cleaned it, but not totally, and did not seem to think it was an issue that should be alarming at all. There was also water leaking through the wall where our A/C unit and hot water is. I have attached photos of the mold that was found. Now, they have come to clean it again this week, with bleach, and I was also able to convince them to hire a mold inspection company to come and inspect the apartment. I showed the inspector the pictures of the mold and clearly explained where it was found. Although I have no official documentation yet, the mold inspection test that was done yesterday did not return any results like I expected. Whenever I have these coughing fits I have been seriously concerned for my life. I do not know what to do now. Could I be allergic to something other than black mold in my apartment?

I went back to the doctor and he said as long as my phlegm is clear not to worry.  Week 5: Went to another doctor for a second opinion.

"Ear, Nose & Throat",https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/19230/mechanism-of-getting-sick,Mechanism of getting sick,"Hello to everyone, I am a new member and have some medical questions. I have no background on medicine (I am an engineer) so maybe my questions and thoughts are very basic and solved but I will give them a try. My main query is about the mechanism that underlies the process of getting cold as well as some extra questions on the subject. To my understanding and judging by experience solely, getting cold is a matter of bacteria growth rate and temperature (conditions). I am not talking about illnesses that are contagious and we get them when someone sneezes on us for example. I am just examining common advice that states ´wear a jacket dont get cold´. What always bothered me is what happened really when we are exposed to cold and our temperature drops. Why would we get sick ? Is it that our immune system gets weaker and it is time for bacteria to step up? If that is true is it bacteria that are already in the air or inside us? If we would lower our temperature in a controlled sterilized environment we can stay at lower temperature for very long times without getting sick?  Does this also mean (if true) that we are talking about bacteria right? But the flu is a virus correct? so we can get it from others only (unless it is also inside us already). Too many questions I know, but most of them are rhetorical. The main question is whether the above is true or not. Is it a matter of rates? At normal body temperature there is a certain bacteria growth that we can always fight but when we go to lower Ts the bacteria rate increases and our system gets weaker so the numbers go up in terms of bacteria? If that, could we say there is a threshold to reach before we get really sick ? (we all have felt almost ill but managed to overcome it before going down with it). The effects of the above could be local I suppose from what I have seen. When I was younger I got a very bad case of throat illness (dont know the name) and now I am sensitive.  If I drink e.g. cold water fast the next day I will have a problem and if I dont pay attention it will evolve and I will get throat-sick needing antibiotics to get well. That has to be bacteria right? (believe me I tried avoiding them but if I dont take them I am finished withing 4 days). This happens once per two years but I have noticed that it seems to migrate. Starts from throat and when it retreats it goes to lungs (softer) to ears and then nose. So here is the second part of my question. Can a bacterial  condition evolve and migrate ? Is that possible or am I getting sicker catching different kinds of bacteria or viruses from the environment (while I am a little weak due to the initial condition).

I'm only 18 and I have a very small mouth so it's terribly hard to remove them. Every time I try, I gag. And even loosening them to some extent gags me when they finally come out. I'm not sure what else to do at this point (I've tried gargling, using my finger, and using a Cotten swab). I'm truly considering getting a tonsillectomy, but I heard that it doesn't always help.

I am a 29 year old male who is having blood tinged mucus from what I believe is coming from the nasal area. I don't smoke (although I did for nearly 10 years I had quit 8 months ago.) There is not an excessive amount of post nasal drip. If anything I seem to get very little of it. But when I do get it or snort it down into my throat there are often streaks of blood in it. Sometimes it is speckled with blood. Sometimes it is tinged pink. Sometimes very little blood and other times The mucus is almost completely red or pink.  Sometimes I will wake up in the morning and check the post nasal drip that has accumulated in my throat and there will be no blood. But later in the afternoon it will appear when ""snorting"" it down into the back of my throat. I have no symptoms of allergies. I am not plugged up. No bleeding from the front of the nose. No symptoms at all other than noticing the blood.  I live in Florida where is is very humid but I do spend a lot of time in an air conditioned home or workplace. I'm not sure if that could have anything to do with this.  Any input on this would be very much appreciated.",Nasal Problems

"Ear, Nose & Throat",https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/19318/concern-regarding-mystery-inner-ear-issue,Concern regarding mystery inner ear issue.,"My 70-year old father was getting ready to go with my mother & I to a local theater on July 29 at around 5:00 pm., at which time he pretty suddenly became very dizzy. He stopped what he was doing numerous times in order to try to regather himself, as he complained of feeling like the whole room around him was spinning. He was able to proceed with undressing, showering, & getting dressed for the show, but by the end of this process did agree with us that he needed to be taken to the ER. Just prior to getting into the car to go, he did feel thirsty, took a drink of water, and vomited within a matter of seconds. Even after vomiting, he complained of feeling nauseous. He also complained of feeling like his right ear was badly blocked, had a loud ringing noise in it, and he really couldn't hear much at all with that ear. He said his left ear felt only a little blocked & he could hear pretty well with it. When we arrived (around 6:30 pm.), theER nurse & physician's assistant examined my father and took him for a CT scan (based upon the signs/symptoms he told of and they witnessed, they didn't think he'd had a stroke, but wanted to rule out anything of the sort). Shortly after the CT scan was performed, the PA can in to tell us it looked perfectly normal and they were diagnosing him w/an inner ear infection/vertigo. They sent him home w/prescriptions for ear drops, as well as for pills to suppress the nausea & dizziness. As it turned out, he never did need to take any more pills for his nausea (they gave him 1 in the ER) and from Thursday (Aug. 3) until today (Aug. 7), he stopped taking the pills to lessen the dizziness (this morning our family dr. recommended he resume taking them). Then, the day after my father's visit to the ER, he still felt very dizzy (although he began describing the sensation as being more like on a very rocky cruise ship, as opposed to the whole room spinning) and was extremely tired, as he slept for much of the day. The next day, my mother & I took him to our family dr., who prescribed a lower dose of the medication for dizziness (the pills he resumed today) & instructed him to continue using the ear drops. During this visit, my father told our dr. of all of the symptoms I've mention previously, but he also said both sides of his head (mostly in the area of his temples) felt blocked and like he had some minimal mucous running down the back of his throat. Then, after not seeing much (if any) improvement at all by Wed., my father called the family dr., who then recommended he see a ENT specialist. The next day (Aug. 3), we drove my dad to the ENT's office. The ENT examined his ears, reported seeing no signs of blockage nor infection and gave him a hearing test, after which he confirmed the pretty noticeable hearing deficit in the right ear & normal hearing in the left. He told my mother & father it's possible the auditory nerve in the right ear ""just shorted out"", in which case the hearing's not very likely to return & balance may continue to be an issue. W/that said, he did also give my dad prescriptions for a ""Z-Pack"", steroid, & another large blue pill that's supposed to knock out both viral & bacterial infections. He told him to come back in 1 week. In the meantime, now in his 5th day of taking these prescribed meds., my father still feels his right ear is pretty blocked and has ringing in it (although both of these things did ease a bit for much of Saturday & this morning, but otherwise returned & remained fairly constant). He also still feels pretty of balance when walking (still like e's on a rocky ship), although he did also see some improvement on Sat., only to have much of it return yesterday & today. . . . He also describes it as feeling like he's having trouble focusing w/his eyes, especially when he first starts walking, but says it does improve a little once he takes a few steps. Much of the hearing deficit is still present in his right ear. He also says he still feels some pressure in both of his temples, though it's the most improved symptom. Finally, I should mention that on July 10 my father did complain of cold-like symptoms, but they were completely gone by the next day w/o an medication. He has also had a history of sinus infections in the past & often sneezes a lot (especially when he 1st wakes up in the morning during spring, summer, & fall). However, he's had no history at all of vertigo/dizziness prior to July 29. So w/all of this said and the fact he really had no warning signs of any of this, but has been experiencing these frightening symptoms for the last 10 days w/only marginal improvement since he began the meds prescribed by the ENT specialist, I'm concerned he may not ever really get better (although today our family dr. did seem extremely certain he will make a full recovery, as he strongly believes it's just a bad case of labyrinthitis (not a dead auditory nerve nor Meniere's Disease). What light can you shed on this involved & somewhat mysterious case of an inner ear pathology? Please help!",Ear Problems

I also see some white spots(what looked like phlegm or puss) on my tonsils sometimes. I am also told that I snore loudly, so I went ahead and looked at my tonsils as they're swollen and saw how small of an airway I have. However, recently my tonsils became extremely painful that it became hard to swallow down my saliva, food, and water. The pain also went to my ears and made my neck hurt when I moved my head. I told my doctor what was wrong and he prescribed amoxicillin, and it worked. However, not even a week or two later, my tonsils are starting to hurt and swell again. What could be causing this issue. It's almost every other day or week that my tonsils get swollen and seems to get worse and worse. Could it be tonsillitis? If this is a constant issue, could tonsils removal surgery be an option?

So I decided to go to the doctor and he took a look in my ear and agreed that it was swollen and he said he couldn't see my eardrum because there was puss in front of it. He diagnosed me with Otis externa (swimmer's ear) and prescribed me some ear drops (neomycin-polymyxin) and I've been taking them as prescribed for a little less than 24 hrs but I haven't noticed my ear feeling any better. I was up most of the night again last night because the pain was so bad.

Eventually one ER provided a homebrewed ""gastro"" solution of lidocaine and antacid that seemed, after several hours, to help. Ever since then after multiple visits to ENTs and gasto doctors, as well as having two CT scans and an endoscopy, the discomfort/pain in the back of the throat persists and hardly improves. The burning is gone but the constant pain and discomfort continue. This condition does not appear to respond to any conventional antacids (Pepcid, liquid antacids), nor large doses of omeprazole or even stronger antacids (Dexilant). About two months ago my lymph nodes under my jaw my neck became swollen and have not gone down. I feel lymph pain in the nodes on the back of my head, under my arm, and (occasionally) around my groin area. The ENT read the radiology report of the last CT scan (with contrast) and said ""everything is fine"".  This is frustrating to me because clearly not everything is fine! The throat pain continues to worsen and the lymph nodes are not going down in size. When i asked for specifics he said they were ""less than 1.5 cm"". Which presumably is the threshold for biopsy. Both nodes are swollen, and painful, which i guess? is a good sign. He recommended only coming back when i get ""night sweats"" and ""significant weight loss""; ie, clear signs of cancer. But he didn't (and frankly no doctor has) has addressed the constant pain nor the lack of response to prescription antacids my condition exhibits. So what should i do in this situation? IE., what course of action? Are there certain keywords or phrases i should use with doctors? Should i try getting treatment at a specialty clinic? It just seems to me that if this condition really was GERD i would 1) have heartburn and 2) respond positively to antacids.",Throat Problems

However, 2 yrs ago suffered a sudden severe BPPV episode - uncontrollable eye movements, falling down & constant vomiting - that required ER treatment. A CT scan ruled out any other cause of the vertigo. I was given a prescription for meclizine 12.5 mg, which I have not had to use again until a few weeks ago. Aspergillus sinusitis: for 12 years have been on immune suppressors - currently infusions of Rituxan - for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The meds compromise my disease resistance enough that 6 years ago I developed aspergillus sinusitis in the right maxilliary sinus.

Subsequently treat symptoms w/ an off-label prescription of Budesonide steroid in a nasal rinse.  BPPV: a few weeks ago, I had another sudden violent episode of BPPV, accompanied by sinus pressure on the left side of my forehead, which took a few days to resolve, using the 12.5mg meclizine pills.

This is my first time posting here since i'm pretty desperate for help. I'm 14 years old and about 6 weeks ago I got a very bad earache. I went to get it checked out at my doctor and she just said my ear & tonsils were a bit red. (*however i had never gotten a cold, or sore throat before the pain started, and i never had any tonsil pain during the earache?*) She gave me Amoxiclav, vitamin C & otipax ear drops. I took all of the above for a week however none of them eased my pain or improved my hearing.  One week later my earache went away however my hearing didn't go back to normal (and hasn't gone ever since).  I'm guessing my eardrum has perforated by the possible ear infection i got.  I should also mention that the day before I went out after taking a shower (with wet hair) so that might've also had an effect, dunno. My hearing loss started 1-2 days after my earache . At first it was kinda severe but then i guess it got better. Now I think I've lost about 30-40% of my hearing. I also started having constant tinnitus (almost every day). It's not bad but sometimes it tends to get annoying. (I think I'm also supposed to hear a popping sound by now but idk, when i yawn (or fake it) i hear some kind of pop/crack, not sure how to describe it; does that count?) I don't really have a problem with following group or phone conversations. I may get a bit confused in noisy places but I've always had this so it's not my ear's fault XD I have yet to see an ENT, since I was waiting for it to heal itself. I will tell my parents ASAP and go check it out properly. I really don't want to have surgery at this age, and i don't particurlarly trust the doctors in my country. I hope i can get a paper patch or whatever it's called if the hole's not big. I'm really worried at this point since I really want my hearing to improve.

My parents' genetics are not very well documented, since my mother has very little record of her birth mother. I do not believe I have been screened for Cystic Fibrosis, as my birth was extremely early, and at that point in time I wouldn't have been able to produce enough sweat for a proper sweat test. Once as an infant I stopped breathing and the doctors couldn't figure out why I had stopped. (I have no more information of this event, only what my parents have recalled to me.) I have been coughing up phlegm regularly now, for as long as I can remember. However, it has gotten worse within the last few years, to the point where I have to cough it up almost every day, and sometimes multiple times a day. Sometimes, when I cough up this phlegm, it has traces of blood in it, however it is never enough to be considered alarming or to the point where I think there might be something damaged in my lungs or airway. I tend to cough up more during or immediately after I exercise, and if left un-dealt with, can even cause me to go into a long coughing fit. I overheat constantly, am almost always dehydrated, and for the most part, underweight despite my considerably healthy diet and constant exercise. I am prone to getting sick, and I am constantly congested despite whether I am sick or not. This happens all year, every year, but gets worse during the summer when I overheat far more, inhale more pollen (allergies), and exercise more. This has gotten so bad, in fact, that I now normally have to stay inside, and even then I still feel the effects almost constantly. I have yellow-tinted skin, which has only appeared within the last seven years or so, and often my skin is rather salty (or at least I assume, considering my dog licks my arms so much). I have tried bringing my concerns up with my mother, however she continues to insist that it is normal to cough up phlegm as often as I do. I insisted that certainly it couldn't be normal to cough up phlegm with traces of blood, however she continued to insist that it was normal, and that she does too have a similar problem at times. My parents do want what is best for me and care for me deeply, however they continue to insist that this is not a large problem. I respect and trust them, however I felt that I should get an opinion from a medical professional. My parents are always present when I am at my doctor's appointments, so I have had no opportunity to mention my worries with my doctor. I have very little of my own money, and if these sweat tests really do cost over two hundred dollars, that would be quite a bit of money for me. I want to at least go to a doctor when I have had the opinion of someone who at least knows a LITTLE about what I might be dealing with. Which leads me here, because quite frankly, I am out of options. Please, help!",

The chiropractor turned my had to each side and I could hear a crack for each side. I felt no pain at all. About 4 hours later I started to feel a sore throat, which seems to have provoked an ear pain as well.  Usually when I have a sore throat I first start feeling sick for a while, and then The throat starts to hurt, but this time was different. My throat suddenly started to hurt and I had a bit of trouble breathing when I first laid down that night (that went away, but the sore throat and ear pain didn't). I have no fever and no other symptoms of cold. The sore throat got worse two days later (on Sunday) and today, 4 days after the adjustment, I am still feeling a strong sore throat and ear pain and have missed two days of work. Yesterday, I went to see a doctor assistant and she couldn't feel any lumps on my neck and tested for strep throat, which came out negative. She said that everything was normal and that it could be a pulled muscle from the adjustment. She didn't prescribe me any medicine and told me to take 3 200mg of Advil every 6 hours (I felt like she should have prescribed me something more powerful against inflammation, as it feels like it's inflamed and it kind of feels like I have a lump in my throat (when I try to eat or drink).

I attend many music concerts and have/am been around loud music but I've always been cautious about plugging up my ears in some way the majority of the time (maybe not just a couple of times throughout the years) I have never experienced tinnitus and have recently gotten my hearing checked and everything checked out and this ear evidently was STRONGER than my left.  I have visited an ENT many times over the past 6 months and he is not sure what is causing it. At first we considered an ear infection but it only occurs during said situations. When he looks into my ear he sees nothing wrong and the eardrum is working properly. There was significant wax build up before but he removed it (although during the right ear cleaning it was very painful). This feeling does not happen when I listen to music without headphones, but it will happen if I listen to music in a car (Ill notice a pressure release if I lower the windows), and if I'm at a loud show close to a speaker. It has gotten to the point where if I am at a show even if I have my ears plugged the vibrations of the frequencies will cause the ear to act up again. Even worse of course if they are not plugged. The last show I went to really did a number on my ear and the pinching/irritated/swelling feeling lasted for almost a week after (but without ringing or hearing loss) Once again, I am having NO ringing and NO noticeable hearing loss. My ENT wants to do a CT scan but I cannot afford this nor do I want the radiation exposure. Once the feeling subsides, as long as I don't irritate it it will go away until exposed to close frequencies again. I should also note that when I try to pop my ears, the problem right ear will delay in popping. I am not sure what to do here and am feeling at a loss with this. Any ideas or suggestions?

My medical issue is undiagnosed but has been affecting me coming up on 18 months.  I seem to have sinus issues that started as a congested nose and since has evolved into a congested nose and congested ears and head ""fullness"". There was also a period of about a month where I developed a ""crust"" in one side of my nostril (left), but went away on its own. It is really burdensome in the way that it deenergizes me on a daily basis. I am lethargic often which is just not how I used to feel. I am hoping someone on here can give me insight into what might be ailing me. I am nervous to go to the Dr. and get prescribed antibiotics which I have heard can worsen the condition.

Things I have continued to do also: smoke tobacco, drink coffee, occasionally eat inflammatory foods such as fried food and soda. Any thoughts would be most helpful.

After about 10 tries, she added more softer and had another nurse come in with a small water machine (don't know the name of it). After one try the machine removed the wax. After the cleaning, I still felt like there was something in my ear, but the nurse said this was normal.

I've told my mom about it and we've went to the doctor and asked about it and he didn't know/didn't think it was anything.

It's really annoying me because people always talk about it, when I talk in video games people imitate my voice because it sounds weird for them, my friends do too.

"Ear, Nose & Throat",https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/9251/vertigo,Vertigo,"Hi I am from Hungary. In November 2015 after a house party I drove home with a littile hangover, mindig my own busieness at home, when -while smoking- I got a rush, seizure or I don't know how to express. I felt hot in my body, got dizzy and very weak and my heart beat strangely. I layed down on my bed to get a rest, but it wouldn't go away until the evening and I felt that something is not good - to say the least. So -given that it was Saturday I guess- I went to the doctor (GP) on duty. She sent me home that it is just from the booze and I should get a rest.. she adviced me some vitamin B6. So I went home but it wouldn't get any better. Or just slightly. On Monday I went to my doctor who sent me to a cardiologyst and nothing was found. I can't recall precisely but I think after a week I went out with my girlfriend to have some food. While eating another 'seizure' came. At that point I literally felt that I'm going to faint. We went to the hospital to have myself chekced. They found nothing. They did another EKG and some blood tests, and I have been sent home to take some B6 yet again.  Fast forward to Jan or Feb 2016. Sunday lunch with family. Again a 'seizure' (sorry I don't know a better word). I've had enough. Went to my doctor again, told her that I want myself checked out thoroughly. Within a span of few months I had a more detailed blood test (TSH), chest X-ray, head CT, head MRI, I've been to an ophthalmologist, a ENT doctor, neurolgist. This last one suggested that maybe I have panic attacks, so I should see a psychologist. I did. And I don't have panic illnes. At least back then I hadn't.. Oh I forgot the main problem I went into so much details.. Vertigo. Almost constantly. It affects my life in so many aspects. Sometimes it gives me a hard time to do my job (IT sysadmin in a school). I can't enjoy life as I used to. Can't play basketball, can't drink alcohol (or very rarely, as it amplifies the vertigo). etc..  So the ENT doctor told me that there is this 'Vertigo test' (again rough translation). They put a device on my eyes (like a VR googles) which has a tiny camera in it which records my eye movement as I am in complete dark. After this they pour water in my ears (googles off) which should make me very dizzy in under 30 secs. Again, I don't remember exactly but my left ear worked properly, I became very dizzy. The right one was complete numb. The girl had been pouring water into my ear (which flows out of it of course) for like 2 mins and nothing. Doctor gave me pills (here called Nootropil and Betarevin) to take them. Took them for months, nothing changed. He also showed me an exercise to do regularly. Got back to him they did this test again. None of my ears would react.. Present. The ENT - sorry this guy is a otoneurologist- doc sent me to a rheumatologist. Now I am recieving massage, and I will attend physiotherapy for my neck that maybe this causes the problems. The ENT doc -in my opinion- has no clue what is the root problem and seems like he doesn't care.  So here I am after a year and a half, living my life on like 50% when I should live it to the max :) And still no cure in sight. I hope I didn't leave out anything from the story.. Dan",Ear Problems

Pressure in ears and head. Very fatigued. Posted 12 days ago Looking for an opinion on my last 2 years of being ill. I'm 46 years old, male, and in a good state of fitness. I'm not over-weight, have never smoked, and rarely drink. I've seen numerous doctors and don't seem to be any closer to a diagnosis. I started visiting my GP with what felt like a lingering flu. Early symptoms included being over tired, pressure in ears, and generally not feeling well. I'd been dealing with a very stressful business situation in the 12-18 months before the symptoms started and was advised that I was probably run-down. Each time I went to the doctor they would take a blood test. Over at least 6 tests they would always tell me something different, but it always seemed to be that I had some unknown virus. At times my blood cell count was too many white cells, or too many red cells. The frustration was they could never tell me what was wrong. I had stress tests for my heart, CT scan and MRI. All came back normal. During this period I would sometimes have 2-3 weeks where I felt normal and was able to work and exercise. These periods of good health never lasted. Fast forward to about 6 months ago. My [now new] doctor referred me to an endocrinologist as it was thought there may be a thyroid problem. My first test did indicate that I may be hypothyroid but they didn't want to give me any medication as they thought it wasn't required. I didn't get any better over the next few months with the same symptoms continuing - pressure in my head and ears, fatigued, unable to concentrate etc. At my next visit to the endocrinologist my thyroid function had worsened slightly and I was put on 50mg of euthyroxine. My blood pressure was also fluctuating a lot with periods where it was around 150/104. I was prescribed medication to try and bring this under control. Around 4 weeks ago I was on a trip away from home and started to feel really awful. I felt my head pressure was increasing and when I shut my eyes the only thing I could hear was my heart beating with a pulsing feeling my head. I had frequent hot flushes, dizzy spells, and never ending ear pressure. I was sleeping frequently for hours during the day, but struggling to get a good nights sleep, perhaps due to building anxiety about what was wrong with me.  Now back home, I went back to the doctor and explained how bad I was feeling. The main symptoms now being extreme fatigue, constant pressure in my ears, and a very strange feeling at the top of my head. I felt on a few occasions that I was going to faint, especially in the morning. I had tried exercising [cycling] one morning, and had to abandon after only a short time. I had also started to feel aches and pains in my legs and back. I explained to the doctor that the main symptoms that were worrying me were the inability to work [tired and no concentration span], the pressure in my head and ears, and the strange pounding sensation from my heart. I was thinking at this time that these may all be connected to being hypothyroid. The doctor ordered a new thyroid function test which came back right in the middle of the normal range. That has scared me as I feel dreadful, and have been pretty much consigned to bed for the last week. When I do get up I feel dizzy. My eyesight has changed. Hard to explain but it's just not feeling normal. I also feel that driving has a different sensation and I don't feel entirely safe. I still have episodes of feeling like I will faint, but never do. My doctor had asked me to take Zoloft [as she felt I was over anxious]. I didn't want to take them but did, thinking it would do no harm. The morning after taking it I felt even worse, with the dizzy feelings increased. Even 2 days later I still feel the effects.  I'm trying to find out what could cause my symptoms and came up with various reports on labyrinthitis. As this seems to be a viral problem that can cause the feeling of ear fullness it seems to be a possibility. It's all I've come up now that it doesn't look thyroid is the source of the problem. Right now, I'm in the worst health I've been in years. I can't work, exercise and need to sleep 4-5 hours during the day. I have constant ear pressure, pressure in my head, dizziness, lack of energy, and muscle pain. Can anyone suggest what this could be. It's been 2 years now and I just seem to get worse.

I sure hope someone out there can point me in the right direction. I'm 35, and all my life I've been very active and agile, and I've had great coordination and balance. Over the past few years (maybe 4-5?) I've noticed that my tendency toward car sickness has increased, to the point that I usually avoid being a passenger if at all possible, but nothing else seemed out of the ordinary and I didn't think much of it.  About 8-9 months ago I started dancing (salsa, etc), and I really fell in love with it. When I began to devote regular time to practicing, and attempted to apply proper technique to my turns, I found that keeping my balance was nearly impossible. At first I thought I just needed more practice, and I'm sure I do, but the more turns I practiced in any one session, the worse I became, to the point that I would have to catch myself on walls and furniture in order not to fall. I feel so unbalanced - like my brain thinks that the floor is somewhere other than where it is. This is always accompanied by a sensation of terrible motion sickness and nausea, which sometimes lasts for hours. Now that I'm aware of it, I notice it more. Any time I change the position of my head quickly, I get very dizzy. Someone gave me an exercise ball for Christmas, and I tried sitting on it at my desk. Within seconds I was nauseous from the slight rocking motion, and I had to stop using it immediately. The other part of the story is that my ears feel...weird. One thing that may be important is that I've been sleeping with OTC ear plugs almost every night for the past 4-5 years. Whether that is related to any of this, I have no idea. As to my ears...I have the sensation that there is fluid in them, often. When I use q-tips to get the water out of them after a shower (please don't lecture me about this; I am very careful), if I press the q-tip gently to the wall of the ear canal, there is a sensation of pressure changing that is really hard to describe - the way it feels when you have water in your ears, before the pressure seal pops. But this sensation feels deeper, and it is always there when I insert a q-tip and move it around...it is like a wall of pressure and it alters as I move the q-tip, but it never disappears - like fluid deep inside my ear that won't budge. I don't know if that made sense, but I definitely did not feel this sense of fluid in the past. Occasionally my right ear will hurt mildly when I blow my nose, for a few days at a time. Then it stops. And then there are bizarre occurrences now and then - like the last time I was in the ocean, I wiped out with a surfboard and got tossed around a bit, and when I came out of the water and I was so dizzy I could barely walk. My head felt completely full of water, and my ears squealed and trumpeted like crazy when I blew my nose. This lasted for quite a while, and the dizziness/motion sickness lasted the rest of the day.  I saw a primary care doc a few months ago, and her examination of my ears was unremarkable, which surprised me, because they really feel like they have too much fluid in them, or something. She referred me to an ENT specialist, and I ended up canceling my appointment, as I really couldn't afford it at the time, and I had a sinking feeling it was going to be another unproductive visit. I started taking ginkgo about 3 months ago after reading an article about its positive effects on circulation and vertigo in some people, and I do think it's helped my circulation but I don't think it's done much of anything for my balance. Other than that, I'm just trying to be careful not to make myself nauseous. I can do all the things I need to do for work, etc, without any trouble, and if I didn't love dancing so much I would probably be ignoring this issue. But something is definitely not right, and i'm so frustrated every time I turn or spin and end up staggering away from my partner and having to catch myself...So. Sorry to write a novel here. I'm just hoping someone out there is going to be like, ""Yes! I know exactly what the problem is!""

My wife had viral bronchitis once before and was able to kick the symptoms after about a week, so I decided to try to do the same. Sometime between then and now, my left ear developed an infection as well; constantly sounds like that ear is underwater (or the sound you get when it ""pops"" from yawning or high altitudes). Bending over causes it to do this ""pop"" and after a few hours, it'll slowly move toward a dull muffle without the pressure. Bit hard to describe. In short, it's now been 11 days and this ear infection is still here. I don't really have any pain, just the discomfort from hearing myself so loudly when I talk (lol) and the occasional pressure that comes from this ""pop"". Is this something that might persist for a few days more until all of my cold/bronchitis symptoms are gone? Should I see a doctor ASAP?

One day, I noticed that my right ear was feeling a little stuffy. I had some hearing loss and I could hear my voice kind of echo in the back of my ear. Then I noticed that occasionally my hearing would get more sensitive, so I held my nose and blew air into my ear and it popped. A lot. It popped like a machine gun (is the only way I can think to describe it). Then, once I had finished blowing air in, it popped like that again even though I wasn't trying to pop it. I would end up having to pop it several times before it would stop. Even after it stopped, only minutes later it would need to be popped like that again. After days of dealing with this, I went to the doctor and he told me that I had fluid build up behind my eardrum that wasn't draining. He said that there was no wax at all (like I had originally thought there might be). He called it something, but I don't remember what exactly he said. He recommended me some over the counter medicine and gave me a steroid shot to help. My ear didn't pop like that for 2 or 3 days afterwards, but today it started acting up again. I'm at a loss for what to do. I've been taking the medicine like I'm supposed to, but it hasn't been working. I thought the shot helped for a while, but I guess it didn't. I haven't had any pain, but it's getting very bothersome. I've had to wear an earplug in that ear all day so that it won't bother me. Even then it still pops a lot. I should probably mention that I'm 17 and have had ear problems since I was little. I have had tubes in my ears multiple times and I get wax blockages very easily.",Ear Problems

My left ear I hear a high-pitched a hissing sound similar to that of a noise cancellation headphones, in addition to the feeling/pain sensation of that of when you leave a back window open in a car and drive down a high way. Sounds in general have a metallic after-sound, that is, when people talk (for example) their word (especially those that contain t's and s's) come with almost like a symbol of a drum set sound and makes it slightly painful.  In both my ears I sometimes hear something like chimes going of or like hundreds of birds chirping at once or the sound of cicadas in the summer. Also in both my ears, though I think moreso my right, common sounds have a ring/whistle to them. For example, from inside my house, the sound of gardeners mowing the lawn I can still hear that sound, but it comes along with another high-pitched ring to it. Another example is my bathroom fan or when I flush the toilet and it fills up with water; I hear the normal fan and water refil sound, but I hear a high-pitched ring/whistle along with it.

HELP!!,"Hello all, this is a long story but I’ll try and make it short. So about 5 days ago, I started experiencing hearing issues in my right ear, in that everything sounded distorted. I am studying abroad in Tokyo, Japan and went to a Japanese ear and nose doctor. The first time he couldn’t find anything wrong with my ear and I passed the sound test (the one with the headphones and silent room). He removed a large amount of earwax and thought that was the issue. Two days later the issue persisted and I went back to the same doctor. He checked my ear and I did the sound test again, nothing could be found wrong with my ears. 	It was at this point the main subject of this post begins. At this point, (yesterday, during the second appointment) he proceeded to do something I have not been able to even research about on the internet. He stuck a long, very thin, metal tube up my nose. This was accompanied by him blowing air through said tube. This was very painful, but the stranger thing is what happened next. While blowing air through, he sort of ‘connected’ his ear and my ear with a tube (maybe he was listening for something or using vacuum pressure??). The tube was maybe 2.5 feet long, and had fittings at each end that were made for ears. After said task was completed he still couldn’t find anything wrong with my ear, and thought maybe my hearing issue was caused by stress. He prescribed me some medicine (which I haven’t taken, seemed sketchy as they were “stress lowering pills”). Anyways my nose/nasal cavity was sore afterwards for the rest of the day. I am awake at 6:00AM now and my nasal cavity is a lot sorer, it feels like the pain in the onset of a sore throat.  	What should I do? Go to another hospital for this new nasal injury? Can it heal on its own? Moreover, has anyone even heard of a doctor doing something like this before? Any help is greatly appreciated, I feel scared right now.

Two days ago, I had an accident doing barbell squats. I was unable to complete my third squat and ended up falling forward.

However, I've also been experiencing an additional problem: I've had headaches, ringing in my ears, and near constant sinus drainage. It got even worse today while I was doing some house cleaning. I had sudden sharp pain in my head and more ringing in my ears, and I ended up having to sit down and stop working. Ever since then the sinus drainage has become even worse, to the point it feels like a water faucet is running down my throat. I went to a clinic earlier today and the doctor said it was likely sinusitis and not related to my weight lifting accident, but I'm not satisfied with this answer. I've had sinusitis many times before, but not like this. I'm wondering if it's really possible I'm having a CSF leak, and if I should go get a second opinion.

It was a heavy metal show, so it goes without saying that it was absurdly loud, but I didn't think anything of it at the time. I had been to several concerts before, and had only experienced a ringing for about three or four hours afterwards. In addition, the noise level wasn't painful to me, so I figured I'd just have the normal side effects of concert-going. This time, things have been a little different though. My hearing has been a bit muffled and there's still a constant ringing in my ears almost 24 hours after the show. My hearing has noticeably improved (although it's still not as great as it once was), but the ringing doesn't seem to be subsiding much, if at all.

I am desperate to figure out what is wrong with me. Ive had head ct scans and mris done and all come back normal. All of my symptoms began with a diagnosis at the VA of swimmers ear, ear infection and upper respiratory infection. I was given Flonase and antibiotics . It seemed as if I was getting better but after the 10 days of being on antibiotics. I was having the headaches still along with ear pain. I have been suffering with these tension like headaches and ear pain for 3 months. I took a ct in and a mri in December a sinus ct in January and In February I took a second ct with contrast and noticed a posterior lymph node swollen to 9mm. Again I took a 10 day course of even stronger antibiotics (Augentin 875) to knock out the infection found on the ct scan of the lymph node. When I was on this course of antibiotics I became very fatigued there were days I would sleep for 15 hours. I got a yeast infection from the meds as well as I feel like I now have a bladder infection. I have too many symptoms going on and I cant get a dr to help guide me to at least figure out why I am having these daily headaches and ear pain. I have crusting in my nose. I believe the lymph node swelling is from a scalp infection but a hair strand test pulled from a dermatlogists read negative. There were small pimples in my head and I did have a lot of itching when all of this started. I have been washing my hair with ketoconazole shampoo DAILY and this seems to have helped with the itching. My hair is very dry though. The pimples on my head still remain. This is weird for me because I havent had acne since I was 18 Im 33 and all of this acne appeared when I started getting sick. My dr wants me to take a mri of my neck with contrast tomorrow. I am worried that all of these scans with contrast is damaging me. My dr wants me to schedule another ct scan with contrast of my neck to see if we should biopsy the lymph node. These headaches and fatigue I am having is ridiculous. I just would like to know if someone can review my blood work or tell me some more tests that I could request that might possible show what the heck is wrong with me.

I stopped getting them almost completely as I got into school age. Now, when I turned 16, things got bad again. I started with a minor ear infection and was treated with, I believe, Zithromax. This gave me some bad symptoms/ side effects. Being the naïve young self I am, I stopped taking this medication too early because my ear pain was gone and the side effects were almost unbearable. The following month, I got another ear infection. I tried telling myself it was just a little pain that would fade, but it got worse. I ended up at the urgent care again. They prescribed another medication. I did take it, but the prescription made my heart race, and I was constantly sweating so much I couldn't even think about my ear pain. As usual, the pain wore off , but I ended up with another the next few months. I eventually was sent to an ENT, where they examined my ears. They told me the pain was due to my allergies, and they ran an allergy test where they found I was allergic to many, many things. I ended up receiving an Epipen that I have to carry around everywhere. Now, I am having more ear pain.

I’ve been given the option of going through the stapedectomy surgery or using hearing aids. I met with Dr. Harris at UCSD who seems to have considerable experience with this surgery. I’m still in two minds about going for the surgery because of the 1% chance of failure and complications. So, I’m reaching out to see if anybody else has got the surgery done in San Diego, through him or someone else and how the experience was or if you faced any complications or lasting discomforts. If the surgery was successful, how soon did the improvement in hearing show up? Thanks for all the support and info on this forum.",Ear Problems

I returned Jan 7th, 2017 and had a bout of cold that lasted a couple of weeks fizzlign out with a course of mucinex and some nasal saline drops. A slight dry cough persisted along with some chest congestion which I ignored. Then some 2 weeks ago, I went back to Austin for a week. This time I caught a strep throat that made me miserable all week. After the trip, the strep went away but left the same niggling deep throat irritation with occasional cough. Well, that has now become much more persistent, with pain in ears, and my chest hurts constantly. I instinctively tend to avoid conversations as a defense mechanism. Oddly enough, my trip to the doctors during last week of Feb showed no strep, no infection, clear lungs. They took blood samples and called in last week with out of spec results on thyroid, liver, and high cholesterol. Just like that, out of nowhere! I have had my issues with acid reflux but till last year, my endoscopy was all clear. There is no reason to believe it is the cause here since my rumination is pretty controlled. Interestingly enough, my wife and father are both showing similar signs of dry cough with no other symptoms. I am totally flipped! HELP!!!",Cold

I have many medical issues, so I'm going to list my history before I get to my question(s). I've had Athsma my whole life and I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis at 16. I also have acid reflux, and I've been sick for the last week and a half now. I don't smoke, I don't drink alcohol, shoot I'm Mormon. I don't even drink tea or coffee. I do have a family history of cancer. Known cancers in my family have been cervical, lung, and colon. As far as being sick for the last week an a half, when I went to urgent care they told me I had a viral infection in my bronchial tubes. It is contagious, but not influenza. Over the last couple days my Athsma stopped kicking up because of it. Now I just have a wheeze when I breathe, and my lungs are rattling when I cough. Sometimes I cough up mucus, sometimes I don't. My chest feels like daggers, and I feel completely drained of energy. I'm feeling lightheaded, especially after blowing my nose. My nose is not stuffed. My ears do occasionally feel full, but only when I move. They pop and go back to normal while resting. Now to get to the point... 2 years ago I went to the dentist and he pointed out that I had a lump on my uvula. It looks white in color, but is obviously covered by skin. He told me not to worry about it unless it got bigger or I got more. About 2 months back I noticed a red dot forming below the white lump. It just looks like a tiny cluster of veins. I wasn't feeling too sure about getting it checked out since I work minimum wage, and have a $100 copay to see a specialist. About two or three weeks ago (before I got sick) I noticed that the soft palate of my mouth had turned a yellowish color. It's never been yellow before. I thought it might go away. It hasn't. Two days ago I looked in the back of my throat again wondering if I was developing strep throat. I've had it before, so I know what it looks like (unless it can somehow change form). I know have two lumps on my right tonsil that are identical to the lump on my uvula. They're almost tucked into a corner, so they can be hard to see. Please note, I have on occasion coughed up tonsil stones. However, I don't think that's what these are. I can usually feel tonsil stones when they get that big, and they break off. These spots are white tinted bulges in the flesh. My questions are... What are they? What could they be? Should I worry about them? How do I get rid of them? What's the cheapest route to Handle this? If I go see my primary care physician, what will he do? Send me to the ENT? Or will he recommend something else? Where would the ENT or PCP send me for testing? Could any of this be related to my illness? AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, I KNOW I HAVE A SUPPRESSED iMMUNE SYSTEM, BUT WHY AM I STILL SICK AFTER A WEEK AND A HALF?! Meds for arthritis: Ibuprofen 600MG (as needed) Plaquinol Mobic Other Meds: Bacoflen (at bedtime as needed for neck muscle spasms) Zantac Singulair Sprintec  Dulera (used only if I know I'm going to be around animals) Ventolin (as needed) Albuterol (as needed, which is not often) When I got sick with the virus I stopped taking Plaquinol and Mobic immediately. I've only been using ibuprofen as needed while my body fights off the infection.  Meds prescribed for current illness: Medrol Zithromax I've already completed full course of Medrol. Two days left for the antibiotic. My ears have been clearing up, but my chest is still crap. Thoughts?","Ear Problems , Cold , Throat Problems , Flu , Nasal Problems"

If I move my jaw side to side I hear air squeezing out from what I guess is in my ear. I also hear like a plastic crinkling sound. This does not happen in my other ear. Also frequently my ear will feel like it needs to pop, but if I use the technique where you hold your nose and blow my ear will fill up but wont pop. If this happens I feel very dizzy and like I'm going to pass out. Swallowing doesnt help either. Also my tinnitus flairs up worse in my right ear than in my left.

I began 5 months ago as a once a month endeavor and it progressed to weekends in a row a couple months later. Each time, copius amounts of cocaine was consumed. My last use was 2/18. Since then, Ive read too many horror stories regarding cocaine consumption and would like to quit while I can. One problem occurred, on 2/19 or 2/20 I woke up with buzzing in my left ear and Ive read that cocaine is ototoxic. I got my ears checked at a local clinic and the nurse couldnt see my ear drums due to wax build up. When she removed the wax she told me my left escherian tube has some fluid build up and is slightly inflamed. I was prescribed flonase and cortisporin ear drops. My concern is the combo of flonase and cocaine. Due to my recent heavy abuse, is it safe to use a steroid based nasal spray? Im concerned that I havent given the soft tissue enough time to heal and do not want to cause further damage. I dont have any bleeding or blood in my mucusAlso, could this buzzing be a result of my escherian tube fluid build up more so than cocaine use or is it hard to say?

I thought I had a bite as the way it first manifested was along cartilage in my left ear- I messed around with it, as I hate infections, boils, pimples, skin tags.... After a month or so, it went to my right ear as the left ear cleared. Never another issue with that ear. This one starts out with layers of skin that seem to collect right in the middle of the curve ( inner cartilage).  At one point, maybe 7 years ago, my ENT did a small surgical procedure to remove a small cyst-like gland in my ear, that seemed to always get infected. For about a year at most, it was better, no more issues.  Now it's been another 5 or more years of getting this inflammation and pain for close to a week, and I need to resort to using a prescription antibiotic, sometimes oral, sometimes topical. I am healing now -it has been 6 days. This is cyclical, I am not quite sure what causes it, or if it could be allergies.  On top of the ear pain is that my esophagus hurts, my vocal chords are hoarse, my singing is BAD, (and I love to sing when I don't have throat problems!) and I have a swollen gland under the earlobe.

(since about 1 year) if i hit my nose (where bone and cartilage meet) not even hard, like just take my palm and repeatedly hit my nose, blood will gush out of my nose. But the weird thing about this is, the blood tastes super salty. The blood only starts to taste coppery when the nosebleed is over. Which usually happens in around 3 minutes. The other weird thing is, the blood clots super fast. If I am bleeding after I accidentally cut myself, the blood doesn't clot that quickly but if I have a nosebleed and blood drips on my hand, it's very viscous and like a gel kind of like when you squeeze orbeez in your hand after only about 1 minute.

"Ear, Nose & Throat",https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/3166/right-ear-pain,Right Ear Pain,"Hello, I am 26 years old, male, studying computer science, lives in Germany. I have no experience in medical field. but what I reckon, I would say the following:   I have pain in right ""midder ear"" or the ""Eardrum"". What I think and feel is that the pain initiates from eardrum or may be middle ear, the pain spreads and I feel it in right side of neck up to right upper head including right upper tooth and right eye. The pain sometime regularly 24/7. sometimes only for 6 or 7 hours every day. sometimes less pain present and later experienced to a severe or intense degree.  The pain first started in 2008. I bear it for 8 years which gives me really a tough time during vocations to go outside, studies, job. In the past,  1) someone extreme slap me 2) I leapt and my brain was not working for 3 minutes. 3) Continous use of mobile's right headphone for 10 - 12 hours (mostly at night time during sleeping as well) . I checked it with different doctors (e.g. General, ENT, Neurologist, Dentist, Psychologist) in Pakistan and Germany but no improvement. I used antibiotics tablets (e.g. Co-amoxiclav 1000 mg) I did CT Scan and other kind of test/xrays which i didn't remember now but all the test/xrays are cleared and there is no symptoms. Everything is fine. I can hear normally. No infection in ear and head. What I observed from my daily life: the pain decreased (not finished completely): 1) keep the ear cover and warm with hat (sometime it also doesn't work) 2) Apply heat to the ear, which may help with pain 3) get up after sleeping comfortably e.g. 8-10 hours 5) any food which produce heat in the body. e.g. hot chicken soup along with eggs mixed.  the pain increased: 1) go outside in the cold or wind with covering my head or ears. 2) stress 3) attending lectures or doing programming for 6 - 10 hours. 4) eating something that is not soft. e.g. dry foods or eating big pieces of bread 5) cold drinks 6) sour drinks or food.

The earliest memory I have of itchy ears is from Kindergarten. I have been struggling with itchy ears forEVER! I've been to multiple ENTs, General Practitioners, and Allergy speciallists... to no avail. My ears still itch, and it's gotten so bad that if you asked me the anatomy, potential conditions, and treatments available of my inner, middle, and outter ear, I would ace the test.  When I was young I had multiple, BAD, ear infections. I had tubes put in. When I was 10 or so, one still had not fallen out (Left). The general practitioner decided to take tweezers and yank it out - I was none too pleased, they actually strapped me to the table. Since that point my itching has only gotten Progressively worse.  My left ear has had two perforations due to infection (in the years after that visit at 10 years old) and it was the only eardrum to disappear after an explosion I was nearby (yes, disappear). My right ear has it's itchy moments, but overall it's very healthy. My left is my problem child.  I have had allergy tests (all negative), multiple ENT speciallists tell me that my ears are super healthy and that there's nothing wrong! What the heck!?! I'm clearly at my wits end - sitting here at work, typing with one hand and scratching my ear canal using a QTIP (oh, the horrors) with the other. I'm at the point where I literally carry around a to-go container of QTIPs, a to-go alcohol, and to-go hydrocortosone. It works for all of an hour, and that's it. Then itching.

It's been almost 5 month since my misery had started, meaning, the ear pressure, to be specific, it's only on the right ear. It all started one day, with lymph node that got swollen next to my tragus, at that day, I visited the ER since I was afraid it was something that might be dangerous. The ENT gave me some antibiotics and some nasal drops, he also mentioned that it will take some time until the swollen lymph node will decrease and vanish. Few days after this issue, my ear got clogged. only the right one.. To make a long story short, I visited almost 10 ENTs, Neurologist, Orthopedist, TMJ (Mouth and dental doctor), few Dentists and other alternative therapists - such as accupatre and chiropractor. Took tons of medicines - including few types of antibiotics, nasal drops (steroids and other), pain killers, anti-inflammation medicines etc. Did a lot of exams - Head CT, Head MRI, tympanometry, audio test, ultrasound exam, X-Ray to my neck and spine, FOL (optical fiber) test and other tests that I can't remember.  All of the exams didn't have any conclusion to what was the issue, all the exams came out fine! - meaning, I'm stuck with it. I must say, I'm 30 years old, vegetarian, eat healthy, working out, working in non-physical job and pretty much having no other issues.

This made my tonsils better until the pills were all done and 3 days after my tonsils felt the same so I tried as many home remedies to try to heal my tonsils on there own at home... but nothing worked, so a week after the pills were done I was back in the hospital with white spots on my tonsils even red ones, my tonsils were so swollen to the point where my tongue has gotten swollen to, my whole mouth had became so red, dry, and irritated, I have shivers/chills all the time, feel like I have a bad fever because my whole body is warm & I feel real weak and flushed out of any energy, also having bad body aches, and sharp chest pains/ a ear ache on my right side.. I could not sleep for 2 days at this point or eat/ drink much.. The doctor told me I now have a very serious bacterial infection, was also tested for mono but do not have that apparently.

Everything cleared up eventually but since then i've had this itchy sensation in my chest (where I would think the Bronchi are or very low down the trachea). I feel no pain. No Phlegm. No Blood. Just over a month ago I I saw a doctor with a slight burning sensation when I urinated. He gave me Clacee (Clarithromycin) 500mg and said it should clear both issues up. After a few weeks the chest hadn't cleared so I went to see another doctor. He prescribed Trisporal (ltraconasole) 100mg + Tavaloxx (Levofloxacin) 500mg. This last friday I went back to see this doctor again and he has no prescribed Sandoz Co-amoxyclav (Amoxycillin 875mg + Clavulanic acid 125mg) 1000. I had x-rays done of my chest and he says i'm clear of Tuberculosis. I did a Lung Flow test where I got 650. My lungs are clear and sound good apparently. Just as an extra I had blood tests done for Chlamydia and my prostate. Everything has come back clear. The itch in my chest is feeling worse today and actually feels like its moving higher up the trachea. My medical aid funds are depleted and i've already spent so much money. The doctor says the next course of action is to see a specialist & possibly do a Bronchoscopy. 15 years ago I had a Bullous Ligation Pleurodesis because I had a Pneumonthorax. I'm concerned that this itch is something more sinister and having gone on so long i'm starting to feel anxious all the time. With the end of the year i'm quite sure the specialist are already on leave and I will only be able to see someone next year. It's a daunting feeling having to wait that long.

I've looked at diagrams and it appears the lymph node is the submandibular node.

I have one now that seems to have roots in me cutting my 50-types of desert weeds I have that grow 4 feet tall! I didn't wear a mask...which was stupid but now I have a sinus infection. Started with congestion day after and 5 days later have full head congestion and yellow thick mucus in sinuses, bad temple and forehead headache, slight fever of 100ish degrees F sometimes. Is this regiment okay? Thank you in advance! I want to know for my kids too because some times they get ear, nose and throat things also and I'd like to avoid commercial antibiotics and OTC meds. Sinus thing I started today: I was going to do this every 4-5 hours, 4 times a day until cleared and then another 3-4 days longer, maybe twice or three times a day. 1. First I mix up a plain pure salt mix, about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon per 6oz clean distilled or purified water a little warmer than room temp, about 80deg F, and set to the side. 2. Then I swish and gargle with 2.5ml Povidone-Iodine mixed with 8.5 to 10ml water or natural mouthwash for 60-120 seconds and spit. 3. Next I'm using a nebulizer (aka essential oil diffuser from Young Living) and I get close to the outlet hole, and breathe long deep slow breaths with a towel over the diffuser and my head for 5 minutes. I do this before and after the sinus irrigation procedures (next) to help better coat and open my sinuses. I fill the diffuser with 2-3oz clean water and add: 2 drops viral essential oil mix like Thieves or On-Guard, 2 drops essential oil mix like Breathe, 1oz pure full strength edible Aloe Vera juice, 6 drops Nascent Iodine, 4 drops white Iodine (has potassium Iodide too, NOT Potassium Chloride). I then fill remainder of reservoir with water. It holds about 4oz total. 4. Then I sinus irrigate with these: Mixed saltwater as above into 6oz squirt bottle, or cup, or neti-type pot, Plus 6 drops Nascent Iodine, Plus 3 drops white Iodine/Potassium Iodide, Plus 1/2 teaspoon 3% hydrogen peroxide. 5. I blow out and then I use the nebulizer / diffuser again for 5 minutes. 6. Then I paint my cheeks, forehead and temples with a cotton ball and Povidone. 7. Before or after I put a congestion rub like Vick's or any other menthol like rub on my chest, shoulders and neck. Does this regiment sound okay to do for 10 days or until the infection is gone, no more than 12 days I'd hope? I don't want to overtake Iodine or irritate anything. So far it doesn't sting & I only notice a loss of taste & smell, but that could be the stuffiness as well I suppose. Lastly if my kids (9 to 14, all healthy) or I had an ear infection also, could I use any of these in the ear? Thank you!","Ear Problems , Cold , Throat Problems , Nasal Problems"

I noticed that when I put headphones on I can't hear as well, and also it seems like I can't hear low frequency as well.  For example, one morning there was a lawnmower outside of my dorm. Now I was rather far away so I could only hear the low rumble of it. And when I covered my left ear, I could clearly hear it in my right in. When I covered my right, I could barely hear it at all.  This appears to be most noticeable in the morning right when I woke up and it eventually seems a little less noticeable as the day goes on. And alongside this in the morning, my right ear will sound weird for a few hours too. To best explain it, its sounds like when I'm sick and my ears are all weird and I can hear myself really loud. Only in my right though. Now more recently, my left ear is making these subtle but intense wind sounds almost. This is so hard to explain, but it is almost like when you put a cup or sea shell up to your ear. It's harder to hear the stuff around you, but there is that intense low rumble in your ear. And I can feel this throughout my entire head and it's very distracting, especially in class. This has been happening more recently. And today when I was doing homework, my left ear got a lot quieter all of a sudden and this happened for like a hour. It was so weird.  I've been having bad headaches for the last 2-3 days. I don't know if this is related, but I can only assume. Lastly, my grandma asked some pharmacist how to drain my ear because I thought maybe I had fluid in it, so I tried taking Zrytec-D, but it didn't really help. Any advise on what this could be?

I have been working with the same employer for over 10 years. It is a large company with 5,000+ employees. Up until now, we have a ""cubicle"" style working environment.

Our company is now moving to an ""open"" floor plan for ""collaboration"" purposes, which is interesting because my position involves highly focused work on your own, in quiet. In a nutshell, the cube walls are coming down. I will now be in a room with hundreds of other employees. Even in my cube, I occasionally need to remove my hearing aids so I can focus without the background noise. Working in a room full of people with no walls is like working in a loud restaurant. I hate bringing attention to myself, but I don't think I can work at my best with this much going on around me. What is reasonable for me to ask for? I can ask to keep my cube, but I will feel ridiculous when everyone else is out in the open. My coworkers are very unhappy with the decision to take down the walls as well, so I feel like they will see anything done for me as special treatment. Any ideas? JS",Ear Problems

She is 7 years old. We have to go see an ID - Infectious Disease doctor. I can't find much in a google search about this as it is considered a rare disease. She does not have TB pulmonary that we know of. I wonder if I should insist the pediatrician order a chest xray? or CT as other tests are inconclusive per articles I read... She has had a multitude of ear infections and now on tube 4 in that ear... the 3rd tube perforated and they had to remove it and added another tube as it was ""swampy"" with infection the doctor said. They took a culture and sent it to New York to be analyzed by a specialist. Now with this diagnosis I have so many questions and don't want to wait for ID appointment. I see things about treatment being chemotherapy related ...is this the only treatment? The doctor only said that there would be different antibiotics orally and into the ear but did not go into details. The doctor says she is not contagious... but how did SHE get in first place? My mother has non-active TB she contracted many years ago, but it was after I was born so not congenital that we know of. Does an infection just out of the blue morph into TB infection?? Did she pick this up from someone else that was sick? I only read that it is normally a secondary dx to Primary Pulmonary TB in most cases... sometimes the ear is primary but does not discuss how it came to be! Some background on my daughter: She had 2 virus's back to back that turned into some kind of super virus and as she was taking a lot of NSAIDS at time developed Steven Johnson's which then turned into Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome right before her 3rd bday. She underwent IVIG Treatment and regained all of her skin back after a week. She then got diagnosed at 6 years old with pneumococcal antibody deficiency and now this?? All these uncommon/rare things happening to her it is making me so worried for my daughter's life! I would just like as much info on possible treatments and what we will be looking to deal with in the long run and what type of important things that I might miss should I ask the doctor. I am not clinical but I work in a family care office so I get the gist of most medical terms but a lot is over my head at this point. She has also had her tonsils removed and her adenoids TWICE as they grew back! She had sleep apnea and multiple tonsilitis/strep cases before the procedures. Now those are gone but wanted to add that for background of her health. Any help appreciated.",Ear Problems
"Ear, Nose & Throat",https://messageboards.webmd.com/health-conditions/f/ear-nose-throat/361/rhinitis-medicamentosa-and-a-cold,Rhinitis medicamentosa and a cold?,"Last month I developed a bad cold and ended up using a nasal spray more frequently than recommended for several days. A couple of times since then I have used nasal spray to clear my sinuses when flying, however I noticed that this seemed to only block up my nose despite it being clear before, resulting in a pseudo-cold for a few days, which I believe was as a result of rhinitis medicamentosa brought on by nasal spray overuse. Luckily as I had not been dependent on the spray for a particularly long time, the symptoms were not too severe and disappeared after 2-3 days. However I have now got another actual cold unrelated to this, with another very blocked nose. I am trying to use alternatives to nasal spray but they are not helping much. Do you think that by now (approximately three weeks since last use) I should be OK to use the recommended amount of nasal spray without experiencing a rebound effect? And if not yet, will I ever be able to use nasal sprays again without worsening the symptoms? Thanks.","Cold , Nasal Problems"
